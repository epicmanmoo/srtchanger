1
00:03:14,594 --> 00:03:17,620
He say, "Good morning,"
and ask, "How is your hand?"

2
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:21,288
It's-- It's better.

3
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:22,728
What's left of it.

4
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:27,205
Sorry.

5
00:03:27,473 --> 00:03:30,237
We would like to speak with you
if you feel well enough.

6
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:32,570
Yeah, that's all right.

7
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,174
-Coffee?
-No, thank you.

8
00:03:40,086 --> 00:03:43,453
Tell us about this place you mention,
in Slovakia.

9
00:03:44,757 --> 00:03:46,588
It's this....

10
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:49,358
It's some kind of factory...

11
00:03:49,929 --> 00:03:52,397
,,,where these people,
these very rich people,,,

12
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:55,659
,,,they pay to torture and kill kids,

13
00:03:56,202 --> 00:03:57,897
Mostly backpackers,

14
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,972
And they killed two of my friends.

15
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:20,584
They take you from this hostel...

16
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:24,289
,,,and they bring you
to this factory and,,,,

17
00:04:25,898 --> 00:04:28,662
I went there looking for Josh,

18
00:04:28,868 --> 00:04:33,305
He was one of my friends
and they took him there and....

19
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:37,873
And they,,,,

20
00:04:38,077 --> 00:04:39,044
They killed him,

21
00:04:42,715 --> 00:04:44,410
It was horrible.

22
00:04:56,195 --> 00:04:57,924
He ask how you survive.

23
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:03,402
I....

24
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:14,345
I escaped.

25
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:27,351
Who organize this place?

26
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:32,930
I don't know.
It's some kind of hunting club. They....

27
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:36,526
They all have the same tattoo.

28
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:37,828
It's a dog,

29
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:39,561
It's a bloodhound dog,

30
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,845
Strange that you mention this tattoo.

31
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,249
Why?

32
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:12,803
Because someone was found dead
in a train station bathroom in Vienna...

33
00:06:13,005 --> 00:06:15,405
...with this same bloodhound tattoo
you describe.

34
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:26,912
Security tapes from this station
show him entering from a platform...

35
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,250
...where a train arrive earlier that day
from Slovakia.

36
00:06:31,457 --> 00:06:33,948
It came through
the same station in Vienna.

37
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:40,432
You were on that tape.

38
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:50,072
Did his tattoo look something like this?

39
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:52,203
What the fuck's going on?

40
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,607
Help! Somebody help me!

41
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,486
Jesus.

42
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:21,597
You hungry?

43
00:07:22,074 --> 00:07:24,099
It's 3:1 5 in the morning.

44
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:27,006
I have to take these with food.
I wanna know if you want anything.

45
00:07:27,246 --> 00:07:30,147
Yeah, I want you to talk to someone.

46
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:33,243
When are you gonna tell
Josh's mother what happened?

47
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,750
I'm not.

48
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:38,920
She still thinks her son's in Europe.

49
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,389
What the fuck
am I supposed to tell her?

50
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:44,620
-She'll go straight to the police.
-Yeah, exactly. Someone should.

51
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:48,961
No, no one should. You don't get it.
These people are tied into everyone.

52
00:07:49,168 --> 00:07:50,601
Somebody starts asking questions...

53
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:52,668
...they're gonna come after me
and find me.

54
00:07:53,072 --> 00:07:56,906
At my grandmother's house? I've
been coming here since I was a kid.

55
00:07:57,109 --> 00:07:59,907
I can barely find the place.
I had to ask my sister for directions.

56
00:08:00,112 --> 00:08:02,137
-You told your sister we were here?
-Yeah. So?

57
00:08:02,348 --> 00:08:04,839
-Well, who else knows?
-No one!

58
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:06,518
Jesus.

59
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:10,144
I'm doing this for your protection too.
You know that, right?

60
00:08:10,356 --> 00:08:12,688
Oh, Paxton....

61
00:08:15,027 --> 00:08:16,016
Look.

62
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:19,029
I took you back because I felt bad.

63
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:21,965
But you're going crazy.

64
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:25,626
You wake up every night screaming,
and I can't sleep.

65
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:27,430
Well, that won't
be a problem anymore.

66
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,267
Paxton, that's not what l--

67
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:32,609
Oh, fuck.

68
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:04,603
Morning!

69
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:25,460
Paxton?

70
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,868
Hey.

71
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,621
Lorna?

72
00:10:56,922 --> 00:10:58,480
Lorna?

73
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:04,194
Sorry. I was trying to be
in the moment.

74
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:06,365
Absorb.

75
00:11:11,737 --> 00:11:14,831
Do you think she ever saw a cock
before this class?

76
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:17,336
If she did, it was in a Botticelli.

77
00:11:17,543 --> 00:11:18,805
Oh, my God.

78
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:22,879
If I hear her talk about how emotional
the Botticelllis are one more time...

79
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:25,846
...I swear to God,
I'm gonna choke the bitch to death.

80
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,091
Until Tuesday.

81
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:37,694
Are you all packed for Prague?

82
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:40,297
-Jeans. No heels.
-Awesome.

83
00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:42,990
I can't do it on the cobblestone.
I don't know how you do it.

84
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:45,295
I can teach you if you bring heels.

85
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:52,175
Axelle.

86
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:04,051
Hands on your pencils, boys.

87
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:21,070
-Would he ever?
-Excuse me, girls.

88
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:22,570
-Excuse me. Hi.
-Hi.

89
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:25,471
-May I see?
-Oh, they're just rough.

90
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:28,203
Show her. Don't be shy.

91
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:33,114
That's the one of you.

92
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:36,719
-Oh, wow, that's beautiful.
-Thanks.

93
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,412
How much would you want for it?

94
00:12:38,624 --> 00:12:40,558
I wouldn't sell them.
You can have this one.

95
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,250
-Really?
-Yeah.

96
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:45,726
-Oh, my God, thank you so much.
-You're welcome.

97
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:48,126
Can I buy you a drink or something?

98
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:51,770
Oh, I'm actually late. We're
catching a train to Prague, but....

99
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:54,303
-I don't know. Maybe some other time.
-Okay.

100
00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:56,338
-Yeah! Okay.
-Okay.

101
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:59,943
-I'll see you.
-All right. Bye. Thanks.

102
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:10,619
No, Dad. It's Prague.
We're gonna be fine.

103
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:12,688
It's not the Ukraine.

104
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:16,594
No.

105
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:20,896
No, Dad,
do not book the Four Seasons.

106
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,533
Book it, bitch. Book it. Please!

107
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:26,694
Because, Dad, no college students
are staying at the Four Seasons.

108
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:31,502
And, you know, it's for old people.
So thank you, but please don't.

109
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:33,643
What?

110
00:13:36,782 --> 00:13:39,182
Yeah. Yes, we have chaperones.

111
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:41,216
Okay, love you. Bye.

112
00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:44,349
Jesus, I hate that he calls
every fucking five minutes.

113
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:47,720
-All right, let's go.
-Hold on. We gotta wait for someone.

114
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:49,658
Who?

115
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:53,789
-Yeah.
-No.

116
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:55,057
-Yeah.
-No.

117
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:57,895
She cornered me in the apartment.
She's homesick, crying.

118
00:13:58,103 --> 00:13:59,730
I felt bad. What am I supposed to say?

119
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:03,136
She's homesick for Baltimore?
We're in Rome, for fuck's sake.

120
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:04,969
She's not that bad.

121
00:14:21,093 --> 00:14:23,186
Wow, is that a new journal
you got there?

122
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:26,190
Yeah. It's a travel journal.

123
00:14:26,398 --> 00:14:27,922
For emotional callbacks.

124
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:30,095
Of course.

125
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:33,538
Lorna, we're gonna grab a drink.
You wanna go?

126
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,705
I'm okay. Thank you.

127
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:39,874
All right.
Well, we'll see you in a little bit. Okay.

128
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:42,607
Knock yourself out, buddy.

129
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,406
See you later.

130
00:14:56,328 --> 00:14:59,229
Excuse you. Asshole.

131
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,571
She's like a 20-year-old grandmother.

132
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:14,871
Whatever. She'll watch our stuff.
She's happy there.

133
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:17,374
That's what she likes to do.

134
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:18,982
Oh, we didn't order these.

135
00:15:19,184 --> 00:15:20,981
They're from girl.

136
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:26,315
Whoa, your girlfriend's stalking us.

137
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,622
Hey. What are you doing?

138
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:32,256
You inspired me to take a trip.

139
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,101
Watch this.

140
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:48,036
You've got to be kidding me.

141
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:49,676
Hello. What's your name?

142
00:15:57,723 --> 00:16:01,352
Do you know where we could score,
like, party favors?

143
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:03,086
What do you need?

144
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:06,458
I don't know.
Like, bud and ecstasy and, like....

145
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,298
PCP?

146
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:11,799
Ice? Peyote? Crank?

147
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:14,165
Okay, okay, bud and X are good.

148
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:17,940
Sure.

149
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:22,538
We go back to my car. I got some.

150
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:24,143
Yeah?

151
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:27,714
-Yeah?
-Okay.

152
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:40,693
Fuck. You know what?

153
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:45,231
I'm trying but I can't find them.
Just hang on, yeah?

154
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:53,008
-You want drink?
-No, I'm fine.

155
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:04,247
Hey, you know what?

156
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:07,584
It's okay because we can just get
it at the club when we go to Prague.

157
00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:09,727
No, stay.

158
00:17:11,463 --> 00:17:13,988
I find them. Okay?

159
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:21,429
You smell nice.

160
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,337
-Whit, we gotta go. Lorna's waiting.
-Yeah, we have our friend.

161
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:27,876
-You have friend?
-Yeah.

162
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:31,413
One, two, three, perfetto, Otherwise,
we have to take turns, huh?

163
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:36,750
You know, we're gonna go,
so never mind.

164
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:41,255
Where you go? I knew you were
a tease, you fucking cunt.

165
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,757
What the fuck did you call me?

166
00:17:42,961 --> 00:17:45,759
I called you
stupid fucking American cunt!

167
00:17:45,964 --> 00:17:47,124
-Fuck you!
-You know what?

168
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:50,824
The train to fucking Prague
is long, you bitch.

169
00:17:51,036 --> 00:17:52,731
We'll come see you.

170
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:54,805
Are you fucking insane?

171
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:56,372
What? I fucking hate that word.

172
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:58,907
"Oh, you stupid American cunt."
I fucking lost my temper.

173
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:01,375
Okay, but it's not like
we're on campus and you can...

174
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,174
...call the dean
and file a report or something.

175
00:18:09,188 --> 00:18:11,383
Oh, my God. Lorna, what happened?

176
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:13,758
Some guy took my iPod.

177
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:15,153
What?

178
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,158
Is there, like, a police officer
on the train or something?

179
00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:20,859
-Yeah. I'll go check.
-Okay.

180
00:18:22,701 --> 00:18:23,963
It had everything.

181
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,671
That's awful. I'm so sorry.

182
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:31,036
I'm sorry.

183
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,638
Here you go.

184
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:52,587
It's those fucking guys.

185
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,892
The fucking guys, the ltalian guys
from the room down the hall.

186
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:58,796
-What do we do?
-Just be quiet.

187
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:08,570
-Hi.
-Hi.

188
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,112
Excuse me.
Did one of you girls lose this?

189
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:13,315
Oh, my God!

190
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,749
How did you know this was mine?

191
00:19:15,954 --> 00:19:19,151
I saw some guy run out of your room.
He tried to take my bag.

192
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:21,958
I fought him off
and this felled out of his pocket.

193
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:24,894
I'm a little worried he might
come back looking for me.

194
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:27,565
Well, do you wanna come in here
and hang out with us?

195
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:29,630
-Really?
-Yeah, we have an extra seat.

196
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:30,961
-Yeah, come in.
-Totally.

197
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,330
Thank you.

198
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:36,934
I think...

199
00:19:37,142 --> 00:19:39,007
...we all need a little of this.

200
00:19:39,978 --> 00:19:41,411
Oh, awesome.

201
00:19:42,814 --> 00:19:44,975
Oh, no, thanks. I don't drink.

202
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:47,109
Thank you.

203
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:49,819
As my father always says:

204
00:19:50,055 --> 00:19:52,250
"Nazdrovia." To your health.

205
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:08,434
So are you going to Prague
for the football match?

206
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,437
I kind of wanna go home.

207
00:20:10,642 --> 00:20:15,102
Oh, I don't blame you. I got
robbed twice on the overnight train.

208
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:17,179
There are so few safe places
left in Europe.

209
00:20:17,816 --> 00:20:19,078
So where are you going?

210
00:20:20,185 --> 00:20:21,743
On a little spa vacation.

211
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:23,254
Where?

212
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:25,017
Slovakia.

213
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,454
Wait, wasn't there, like,
some war in Slovakia?

214
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,791
There hasn't been war in Slovakia
for 50 years.

215
00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:33,225
That's Bosnia, darling.

216
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:35,730
-Oh, like you knew.
-I did so.

217
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:37,458
What are the spas like there?

218
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:41,298
They're the best natural hot springs
in the world.

219
00:20:41,506 --> 00:20:45,567
I go twice a year. It's great to get away
from the ltalian guys.

220
00:20:45,777 --> 00:20:47,108
They get to be a bit much.

221
00:20:48,313 --> 00:20:50,304
Wow, hot springs?

222
00:20:50,515 --> 00:20:53,882
That sounds so therapeutic.
I wanna go.

223
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:57,613
It's very easy. You just have to
switch trains in Prague.

224
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:01,020
It could be nice.

225
00:21:01,326 --> 00:21:05,786
You know? I had enough gross guys
for one weekend.

226
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:08,797
Okay, we'll go.

227
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:14,964
Do you know of a good place to stay?

228
00:21:16,341 --> 00:21:21,335
-Smart move with the shoes.
-What? It's so easy. You have to try it.

229
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:51,939
Hi. Can I help you?

230
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:54,635
-I need a room for my friends, please.
-Yeah, cool.

231
00:21:54,846 --> 00:21:56,837
Your passports, please.

232
00:22:00,752 --> 00:22:02,845
American. Good.

233
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:05,785
Yeah, cool. It's 1 0 Euros for night.

234
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:09,050
No. I got this one.

235
00:22:09,261 --> 00:22:10,523
No. It's on me.

236
00:22:10,729 --> 00:22:12,993
-Thank you.
-Money.

237
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:14,992
Thanks.

238
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:18,734
Here are your keys.

239
00:22:20,305 --> 00:22:23,900
And this is a notice for
the harvest fair tonight, girls.

240
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:26,942
Will be sexy good times. Come on.

241
00:22:27,145 --> 00:22:29,978
It's Dozinky, I know that.
They have it every year.

242
00:22:30,382 --> 00:22:33,874
-Yeah.
-Lots of music, dancing, costumes.

243
00:22:34,086 --> 00:22:36,145
Oh, my gosh! Could we go?

244
00:22:37,823 --> 00:22:40,314
-lt sounds kind of gay.
-Excuse me.

245
00:22:46,665 --> 00:22:48,997
Oh, we are so going to
the harvest festival.

246
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:52,534
-Come on. This way.
-Thank you.

247
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:55,039
You're welcome.

248
00:22:57,943 --> 00:23:00,810
Do you think they have any frescoes
in the room?

249
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:25,536
Wow, this room feels so timeless.

250
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:27,637
Are you kidding right now?

251
00:23:30,842 --> 00:23:31,866
Oh, my God!

252
00:23:33,211 --> 00:23:34,974
Sexy.

253
00:23:36,314 --> 00:23:37,713
Come here,

254
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,870
Yes! Yes!

255
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:51,842
Yeah!

256
00:25:52,651 --> 00:25:54,278
That's what I'm talking about, huh?

257
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:18,570
Todd, what's up?

258
00:26:19,945 --> 00:26:22,937
Yeah, nothing.
We're just finishing up breakfast.

259
00:26:25,483 --> 00:26:26,848
Really?

260
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:32,322
Wow, I didn't think--

261
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:36,359
Jesus. You sure?

262
00:26:37,462 --> 00:26:42,525
Yeah, yeah, okay. I can go right now.
I'll tell her I have to meet a client.

263
00:26:43,301 --> 00:26:44,893
Okay.

264
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:46,997
See you.

265
00:26:56,247 --> 00:26:59,375
No respect for me,
No respect for mother earth,

266
00:26:59,584 --> 00:27:02,451
Well, don't you have
anything to say for yourself?

267
00:27:04,255 --> 00:27:06,723
Well, that's just fine,
We can all ride home in silence,

268
00:27:14,232 --> 00:27:17,963
Gosh! This village is so enchanting.

269
00:27:18,436 --> 00:27:20,802
Lorna, are you having a
"journal-gasm" right now?

270
00:27:21,006 --> 00:27:23,031
Actually, yes. Multiple ones.

271
00:27:23,241 --> 00:27:26,267
I get to write about
how beautiful this village is...

272
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:28,969
...and I get to write about
what a raving bitch you are.

273
00:27:31,583 --> 00:27:33,551
She comes back swinging!

274
00:27:33,752 --> 00:27:36,448
-Well-played.
-Thank you.

275
00:27:39,724 --> 00:27:40,691
Dollar!

276
00:27:41,426 --> 00:27:42,484
Dollar!

277
00:27:42,927 --> 00:27:44,690
Do you guys have a dollar?

278
00:27:44,896 --> 00:27:47,296
-I got it.
-Oh, no, no, no.

279
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:50,434
No, no, no. I got it. I got it.
Let me.

280
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,974
I have Smints.

281
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:00,639
Would you like a Smint?

282
00:28:13,224 --> 00:28:14,919
Bitches!

283
00:28:21,566 --> 00:28:23,693
Welcome to Slovakia.

284
00:28:31,743 --> 00:28:35,270
You both have corner suites
with views of the river.

285
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,539
Here are your pagers.

286
00:28:37,749 --> 00:28:40,513
Perfect. Thank you.

287
00:28:42,687 --> 00:28:45,417
-You ready to do this?
-Yeah, I'm ready.

288
00:28:46,191 --> 00:28:47,590
Really?

289
00:28:47,792 --> 00:28:50,260
Because you look like
your dog just died.

290
00:28:50,462 --> 00:28:53,158
I'm just jet-lagged, man.
I'll take a shower and I'll feel better.

291
00:28:53,364 --> 00:28:55,594
-All right.
-Thanks.

292
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:01,702
Oh, my God!

293
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:00,695
Hey, guys!

294
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:02,190
Yes?

295
00:30:02,667 --> 00:30:04,294
For the apartment.

296
00:30:04,602 --> 00:30:06,536
Awesome, dude.

297
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:09,434
Those swords are like 1 000 Euros.

298
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:11,768
Trust me, she can afford it.

299
00:30:12,744 --> 00:30:15,645
Does she get, like,
a really big allowance?

300
00:30:15,947 --> 00:30:18,313
No, it's more like an inheritance.

301
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:22,444
Her mom died when she was 1 2 and,
like, left her everything.

302
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:24,519
And so she keeps her dad
on an allowance.

303
00:30:25,857 --> 00:30:27,449
-Really?
-Yeah.

304
00:30:28,626 --> 00:30:31,857
She could pretty much buy Slovakia
if she wanted to.

305
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:36,759
Yeah. It's pretty rad.

306
00:31:03,828 --> 00:31:05,386
Yeah!

307
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:08,396
Badass.

308
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:11,660
Let me see this motherfucker.

309
00:31:16,741 --> 00:31:18,436
You're up, bro.

310
00:31:22,013 --> 00:31:24,948
I think I'm gonna pass on the tattoo.

311
00:31:25,183 --> 00:31:26,582
Come on, man, sit down.

312
00:31:26,784 --> 00:31:30,151
A tattoo's not really me.
It's not my style.

313
00:31:30,355 --> 00:31:34,155
I didn't know and I don't like needles.
I don't like needles very much.

314
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:36,850
Dude, what are you doing? Sit down.

315
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:39,962
Here's the problem. Linda. What
is she gonna say when she sees this?

316
00:31:40,164 --> 00:31:43,565
My wife is not gonna
really understand.

317
00:31:43,768 --> 00:31:46,236
Is there some other option?

318
00:31:47,005 --> 00:31:49,599
Everyone must get tattooed.
Part of contract.

319
00:31:49,974 --> 00:31:50,941
Yeah.

320
00:31:51,175 --> 00:31:52,369
Let's do it. Come on, man.

321
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:54,602
Why don't you sit down?
These guys aren't playing.

322
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:57,473
A tattoo is
a little difficult to explain, Todd.

323
00:31:57,682 --> 00:31:59,673
Didn't seem like you had
any problem explaining...

324
00:31:59,884 --> 00:32:02,216
...the gonorrhea you brought back
from Thailand.

325
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,911
Can't believe you're bringing up
the gonorrhea. Every time--

326
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,289
Is there any problem here?

327
00:32:07,492 --> 00:32:10,950
No, no. I just didn't know
that this was part of it.

328
00:32:14,565 --> 00:32:15,964
Stuart.

329
00:32:16,167 --> 00:32:20,968
This is not like going to a whorehouse.
You can't just back out.

330
00:32:26,844 --> 00:32:29,642
Get in the fucking chair.

331
00:32:36,321 --> 00:32:37,913
Yeah.

332
00:32:39,991 --> 00:32:42,585
Come on, man. Look at this.

333
00:32:43,027 --> 00:32:45,222
I'm fucking proud of mine.

334
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,680
Look what I found!

335
00:33:05,216 --> 00:33:08,879
Okay, and before you say anything,
it's cider, it's non-alcoholic...

336
00:33:09,087 --> 00:33:11,248
...and those little kids right there
made it.

337
00:33:11,456 --> 00:33:13,117
-Oh, my gosh, really?
-Yeah.

338
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:15,258
-I'm gonna go say thank you.
-Okay.

339
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:17,860
They don't speak much English.

340
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:24,767
This is quite possibly the most
alcoholic cider I've ever tasted.

341
00:33:25,069 --> 00:33:26,696
Come on, it's good for her.
She needs it.

342
00:33:26,904 --> 00:33:28,462
Thank you.

343
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:30,975
Well, cheers.

344
00:33:36,414 --> 00:33:38,143
Oh, my God, my song! Let's go!

345
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:41,045
Come!

346
00:33:45,757 --> 00:33:48,157
Come on, Borat.
Let's see what you got.

347
00:34:08,413 --> 00:34:09,937
There they are.

348
00:34:10,148 --> 00:34:11,274
Three o'clock.

349
00:34:11,783 --> 00:34:13,444
-Jesus.
-Right?

350
00:34:13,651 --> 00:34:15,881
It's fucking crazy, huh?
Dead ringer.

351
00:34:16,087 --> 00:34:18,487
Happy fucking birthday, bro.

352
00:34:22,126 --> 00:34:25,459
-Dude, where you going?
-ln for a better look.

353
00:34:51,289 --> 00:34:52,256
Me?

354
00:35:33,764 --> 00:35:35,231
Hi.

355
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:37,093
Hi.

356
00:35:37,335 --> 00:35:40,964
Would you like to dance with me?

357
00:35:42,507 --> 00:35:44,407
No, thank you. I'm--

358
00:35:44,609 --> 00:35:46,042
I'm not nearly drunk enough.

359
00:35:46,244 --> 00:35:47,734
Come on. I'll show you how.

360
00:35:47,945 --> 00:35:50,072
No, really. It's easy.

361
00:35:52,049 --> 00:35:56,349
No. Thank you, really, but my feet.
I'm tired.

362
00:35:59,423 --> 00:36:01,584
I could have helped you.

363
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:05,124
Excuse me?

364
00:36:12,236 --> 00:36:13,203
Hey.

365
00:36:14,305 --> 00:36:15,533
Hey.

366
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:18,368
That guy make you some troubles?

367
00:36:18,643 --> 00:36:21,043
No. He's fine.

368
00:36:22,747 --> 00:36:24,977
What he say to you?

369
00:36:26,484 --> 00:36:28,714
Nothing. He just wanted to dance.

370
00:36:30,588 --> 00:36:33,148
He won't bother you anymore.

371
00:36:34,091 --> 00:36:36,286
Oh, he wasn't bothering me.

372
00:36:40,431 --> 00:36:43,093
Here. Take a drink.

373
00:36:50,575 --> 00:36:53,772
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

374
00:37:00,518 --> 00:37:02,315
-Oh, I'm so sorry!
-Don't worry about it.

375
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,488
I'm so, so sorry. I'm such an idiot.

376
00:37:04,689 --> 00:37:06,213
No, it's all right.

377
00:37:06,691 --> 00:37:09,387
-Here, let me get you a drink.
-No, you don't need to.

378
00:37:09,594 --> 00:37:10,925
-No, I insist.
-No, no.

379
00:37:11,128 --> 00:37:12,857
I insist.

380
00:37:21,939 --> 00:37:24,134
Beth! Beth!

381
00:37:24,342 --> 00:37:27,778
Beth! Oh, my God, Roman wants to
take me on a boat ride...

382
00:37:27,979 --> 00:37:29,913
...and he's just so suave
and he's amazing...

383
00:37:30,114 --> 00:37:32,844
...and he doesn't speak English,
but we understand each other.

384
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:37,987
Yeah. Just promise me you won't
go on a boat ride with him, okay?

385
00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:39,486
Why not?

386
00:37:39,724 --> 00:37:41,555
What's the big deal?
You don't fancy him?

387
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:45,354
Just because he's not "Whitney
approved" or "Beth approved" looking?

388
00:37:45,563 --> 00:37:48,862
No, I'm not saying that at all. I just
want you to stay here where it's safe...

389
00:37:49,066 --> 00:37:50,897
...we're all together,
we don't get separated.

390
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:53,332
Just promise me
you won't go on a boat ride with him.

391
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:05,271
Lorna, promise me
you won't go on a boat ride with him.

392
00:38:06,417 --> 00:38:10,148
Beth. It's okay.

393
00:38:10,354 --> 00:38:12,652
-Okay. You promise?
-Okay, okay, okay.

394
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:14,489
Okay.

395
00:38:15,893 --> 00:38:17,588
Roman.

396
00:38:18,362 --> 00:38:20,330
Okay, two, please.

397
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:25,762
-Here you go. I'm so sorry about that.
-It's okay.

398
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:28,336
-Cheers.
-Cheers. Thanks.

399
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:36,036
So, what brings you
to this corner of the world?

400
00:38:36,914 --> 00:38:39,644
Her. Firestarter.

401
00:38:40,851 --> 00:38:42,341
And you?

402
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:46,983
I honestly don't know.

403
00:38:49,927 --> 00:38:52,521
I'm sorry, there's probably...

404
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:55,665
...a small army of Slovak boys
all fighting over you.

405
00:38:55,866 --> 00:38:59,495
Why travel all this way
just to talk with an ugly American?

406
00:38:59,704 --> 00:39:01,695
You're not that ugly.

407
00:39:01,906 --> 00:39:03,430
Really?

408
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:06,233
Well, cheers to that.

409
00:39:06,444 --> 00:39:07,934
Cheers.

410
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:10,905
Hey, your friend looks like
she's having fun.

411
00:39:12,316 --> 00:39:13,476
Yeah.

412
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:16,084
I get to listen to them have sex later.

413
00:39:17,788 --> 00:39:20,313
Can we switch?
I'm over at the Dvorzak hotel and...

414
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:24,354
...it's probably been three centuries
since anybody's had sex over there.

415
00:39:25,563 --> 00:39:27,690
Oh, maybe your table's ready.

416
00:39:29,467 --> 00:39:32,732
That's-- That's a long story.

417
00:39:33,738 --> 00:39:35,569
Well, I'll have to hear about it
another time.

418
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,774
I'm gonna take off,
but it's a small village...

419
00:39:37,975 --> 00:39:39,966
-...I'm sure we'll meet again.
-I'm sure we will.

420
00:39:40,177 --> 00:39:41,940
All right. Good night.

421
00:39:42,413 --> 00:39:43,539
Good night, Beth.

422
00:39:45,149 --> 00:39:46,912
Did I tell you my name?

423
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:49,379
No, no. I heard your friend use it.

424
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:53,415
But I forgot to tell you mine. I'm Stuart.

425
00:39:53,691 --> 00:39:55,659
Good to meet you, Stuart.

426
00:39:56,193 --> 00:39:57,717
Good night.

427
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:10,431
Lorna!

428
00:40:13,477 --> 00:40:14,967
Lorna!

429
00:40:21,819 --> 00:40:23,150
Lorna.

430
00:40:24,655 --> 00:40:26,646
Excuse me.

431
00:40:31,962 --> 00:40:33,224
Lorna!

432
00:40:35,633 --> 00:40:36,793
Lorna!

433
00:40:37,802 --> 00:40:39,963
Beth, I'm sorry!

434
00:40:41,038 --> 00:40:42,903
You promised.

435
00:40:43,507 --> 00:40:45,304
I know.

436
00:40:45,509 --> 00:40:47,500
I'm sorry!

437
00:41:26,283 --> 00:41:28,649
It's so peaceful.

438
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,886
It's so secluded.

439
00:41:36,427 --> 00:41:39,021
Roman, what are you doing?

440
00:41:49,406 --> 00:41:50,373
Come to me.

441
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:01,151
Close your eyes.

442
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:05,512
Roman! Roman!

443
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:10,350
Roman! Roman!

444
00:42:10,561 --> 00:42:12,893
Roman! Roman!

445
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:34,843
--on a boat
and I have no idea where she is.

446
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:38,419
-How does she get back from that?
-Beth, come on!

447
00:42:39,623 --> 00:42:41,488
Oh, fuck!

448
00:42:43,027 --> 00:42:44,756
Beth!

449
00:42:45,462 --> 00:42:47,794
I cannot leave her alone with this guy.

450
00:42:47,998 --> 00:42:51,434
You know, you just go ahead
and I'll wait for Lorna.

451
00:42:51,635 --> 00:42:53,603
-You go. Yeah.
-Yeah?

452
00:42:53,804 --> 00:42:55,669
-All right. Thank you so much.
-Okay.

453
00:42:55,873 --> 00:42:57,363
-Sure. Yeah.
-Thank you.

454
00:42:57,708 --> 00:42:59,005
Fuck!

455
00:42:59,209 --> 00:43:01,973
-Dude, are you coming?
-Are you okay?

456
00:43:02,179 --> 00:43:03,874
I'm good. I'm good. No, I'm fine.

457
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:05,912
-Are you all right?
-Dude, I'm fine.

458
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:08,275
Have another cocktail.

459
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:14,621
All right, good night.

460
00:43:15,326 --> 00:43:17,487
No, Whit. We're going to sleep.

461
00:43:17,695 --> 00:43:18,957
-We are?
-Yeah.

462
00:43:19,163 --> 00:43:22,291
Okay, is he hot,
or is he too, like, eastern bloc?

463
00:43:22,499 --> 00:43:25,696
He's fine. But can we please go
get some rest? Come on.

464
00:43:25,903 --> 00:43:27,700
Oh, you're so sweet. No, I'm fine.

465
00:43:27,905 --> 00:43:29,873
It's okay. I'll take care of her.

466
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:33,869
I'm sure you will, but not tonight,
all right? Good night, Miroslav.

467
00:43:34,078 --> 00:43:36,103
Good night, Miroslav!

468
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:46,456
I'm sorry. He was just so shady.

469
00:43:46,991 --> 00:43:49,516
Whatever. I wanted to fuck him, but....

470
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:53,387
I know you did. I'll make it up to you.

471
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:57,692
I guess Mr. Rabbit's gonna have to
go down the hole again tonight.

472
00:44:00,604 --> 00:44:02,128
Do you have a AA?

473
00:44:02,573 --> 00:44:04,302
Mr. Rabbit!

474
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:06,799
Come here, Rabbit!

475
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:15,111
Do you remember the first guy
in your high school to get laid?

476
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:16,547
No, but I remember the last.

477
00:44:16,754 --> 00:44:18,915
Well, I do. This kid Greg.

478
00:44:19,123 --> 00:44:23,822
He came back from summer break,
something about him had changed.

479
00:44:24,028 --> 00:44:27,293
It wasn't anything he said or did, but
something was different. You knew it.

480
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:31,457
I know what you mean. It's like you can
sense it the way an animal senses it.

481
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:33,159
Exactly. Like an animal.

482
00:44:33,437 --> 00:44:36,895
Sometimes you meet a guy and there's
something fucking scary about him...

483
00:44:37,107 --> 00:44:39,905
...something that makes you think,
"This guy has killed somebody."

484
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:43,238
He doesn't have to act tough.
He never has to say it.

485
00:44:43,447 --> 00:44:46,075
But like an animal, you can sense it.

486
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:50,509
You know that this guy's got the balls
to do what few others can.

487
00:44:51,288 --> 00:44:53,313
And that's you after today, my friend.

488
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:56,584
People are gonna fucking fear you.
Linda is gonna fucking fear you.

489
00:44:56,794 --> 00:45:01,595
What we do today is gonna pay off
every day for the rest of our lives.

490
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:05,327
-Where's your pager?
-It's back in the room.

491
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:07,800
-Come on. What the fuck?
-I just figured you had yours.

492
00:45:08,005 --> 00:45:10,803
Is it me? Because it feels like
you're, like, having second thoughts.

493
00:45:11,008 --> 00:45:13,943
You've never really been into this.
I feel like I'm talking you into it.

494
00:45:14,144 --> 00:45:16,704
I don't wanna be doing something
and keep talking about it--

495
00:45:16,914 --> 00:45:21,442
-It's different from taking on an image.
-I am so fucking tired of talking about it.

496
00:45:21,652 --> 00:45:23,950
It's time we fucking do it.

497
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:34,864
To the next level.

498
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:37,124
To the next level. No, wait.

499
00:45:37,334 --> 00:45:39,165
Isn't it bad luck to toast with water?

500
00:45:39,369 --> 00:45:43,237
Yeah. Bad luck
for whoever meets us today.

501
00:45:47,945 --> 00:45:50,436
Yeah. Let the games begin.

502
00:46:10,968 --> 00:46:12,526
Hard, hard, hard.

503
00:46:12,736 --> 00:46:14,397
Hey.

504
00:46:14,905 --> 00:46:18,341
-Hey, did she call?
-No. I just checked.

505
00:46:18,909 --> 00:46:21,776
I love that Lorna's the only one of us
that got any action last night.

506
00:46:21,979 --> 00:46:25,346
-Hey, I tried.
-Keep trying.

507
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:28,675
Yeah, she'd say
this place is majestic.

508
00:46:28,886 --> 00:46:29,853
Sure.

509
00:46:30,053 --> 00:46:31,884
I bet she's making him
breakfast right now.

510
00:46:32,089 --> 00:46:33,613
No, I bet she's in a cum coma.

511
00:46:34,391 --> 00:46:36,086
Thank God.

512
00:46:37,394 --> 00:46:39,692
At least she has something
to write about in her journal.

513
00:50:45,575 --> 00:50:47,065
Please! Please!

514
00:50:47,277 --> 00:50:49,074
Please! Stop!

515
00:50:49,346 --> 00:50:50,472
No!

516
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:53,274
Stop! Please! Please!

517
00:51:00,123 --> 00:51:01,647
Please! Please!

518
00:51:01,858 --> 00:51:04,554
Please, no!

519
00:52:32,582 --> 00:52:34,209
Relax.

520
00:52:38,421 --> 00:52:40,013
Come up here.

521
00:54:12,882 --> 00:54:14,440
Whit?

522
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:25,057
Axelle?

523
00:54:45,982 --> 00:54:47,540
Fuck.

524
00:54:50,887 --> 00:54:52,411
Whit!

525
00:54:54,324 --> 00:54:56,121
Guys!

526
00:55:00,196 --> 00:55:02,721
Axelle! Whit!

527
00:55:46,810 --> 00:55:48,243
Stop. Please help me!

528
00:55:48,445 --> 00:55:49,935
-Go away.
-Please help me!

529
00:55:50,146 --> 00:55:51,579
-Just go away from me!
-No, no, no.

530
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:53,949
Help me.
These men are chasing me. Please.

531
00:55:54,150 --> 00:55:57,950
I tried to help, but you don't listen.
Go away!

532
00:56:27,984 --> 00:56:29,747
Dollar, bitch!

533
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:39,756
Stop!

534
00:57:11,895 --> 00:57:13,453
Get in.

535
00:57:13,696 --> 00:57:15,163
Yeah.

536
00:59:48,651 --> 00:59:51,211
The police will be here soon.

537
00:59:51,854 --> 00:59:53,913
They are looking for your friends.

538
00:59:54,657 --> 00:59:56,284
Thank-- Thank you.

539
00:59:56,893 --> 00:59:58,417
More tea?

540
00:59:58,828 --> 01:00:00,295
Please.

541
01:00:06,002 --> 01:00:07,435
Thank you.

542
01:00:22,585 --> 01:00:24,348
So, you and Sasha...

543
01:00:24,821 --> 01:00:28,222
-...are you two...?
-Oh, no. God, no.

544
01:00:28,424 --> 01:00:30,153
He's old enough to be my dad.

545
01:00:32,428 --> 01:00:34,055
What does he do?

546
01:00:34,263 --> 01:00:36,094
He does auctions.

547
01:00:36,566 --> 01:00:38,966
Come. Let's get you some clothes.

548
01:01:08,031 --> 01:01:09,828
No!

549
01:01:10,033 --> 01:01:11,591
No!

550
01:01:13,636 --> 01:01:16,799
Help! No! No!

551
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:37,785
What did I do wrong?

552
01:01:40,663 --> 01:01:44,121
Please don't hurt me.
Please don't hurt me. I'm sorry.

553
01:01:44,934 --> 01:01:46,731
Please don't hurt me.
Please don't hurt me.

554
01:01:46,936 --> 01:01:49,131
I not hurt you.

555
01:01:49,472 --> 01:01:51,838
Okay. It's okay.

556
01:01:52,041 --> 01:01:53,201
I clean you up.

557
01:01:54,110 --> 01:01:56,544
Please, please help me.

558
01:01:57,413 --> 01:01:59,404
You have a bruise.

559
01:02:02,485 --> 01:02:04,009
What is that?

560
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:05,881
What are you doing?

561
01:02:07,623 --> 01:02:09,557
I make you pretty.

562
01:02:10,927 --> 01:02:12,360
Pretty for what?

563
01:02:13,296 --> 01:02:14,991
For the client.

564
01:02:15,331 --> 01:02:17,458
Client? What client?

565
01:02:45,394 --> 01:02:46,725
Give me. No.

566
01:02:46,963 --> 01:02:47,930
No.

567
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:52,158
We do...

568
01:02:53,035 --> 01:02:54,969
...nails.

569
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:18,518
No!

570
01:03:28,638 --> 01:03:30,697
No! No!

571
01:03:36,979 --> 01:03:38,810
Oh, my God.

572
01:03:40,416 --> 01:03:41,815
No!

573
01:03:51,794 --> 01:03:53,523
I'm worried about Whit.

574
01:03:55,898 --> 01:03:58,025
Whitney seems like a tough girl.

575
01:03:58,234 --> 01:04:00,202
She'll be okay.

576
01:04:03,706 --> 01:04:05,833
You have a scratch.

577
01:04:07,844 --> 01:04:09,209
Yeah.

578
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:21,881
-It's sore.
-I'm sorry.

579
01:04:22,892 --> 01:04:25,793
You have such beautiful skin.

580
01:04:25,995 --> 01:04:27,519
Thank you.

581
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:32,360
Who's that?

582
01:04:33,402 --> 01:04:35,370
Just some friends.

583
01:04:36,038 --> 01:04:37,835
Come. You should lie down.

584
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:40,008
I'll wake you up when the police arrive.

585
01:06:40,529 --> 01:06:42,326
Do you think we're sick?

586
01:06:43,866 --> 01:06:45,026
Fuck, no.

587
01:06:45,768 --> 01:06:48,498
Dude, you look anywhere in the world
where there's no law...

588
01:06:49,171 --> 01:06:51,901
...whether it's fucking Chad
or New Orleans...

589
01:06:52,108 --> 01:06:54,133
...and this is the shit
people are doing, bro.

590
01:06:56,345 --> 01:06:58,279
We're the normal ones.

591
01:07:04,553 --> 01:07:06,214
Any idea what
you're gonna do in there?

592
01:07:09,525 --> 01:07:11,584
You don't even wanna know.

593
01:07:13,295 --> 01:07:15,456
You don't even wanna know.

594
01:10:45,007 --> 01:10:46,565
Jesus.

595
01:11:56,912 --> 01:11:58,607
They're listening. They're listening.

596
01:12:00,115 --> 01:12:04,176
Beth, it's me. It's Stuart.
From the fair.

597
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:07,455
Don't talk loud. Okay?

598
01:12:07,656 --> 01:12:10,420
If they hear us talking like this...

599
01:12:10,759 --> 01:12:12,454
...they're gonna fucking kill us both.

600
01:12:13,262 --> 01:12:14,354
You hear me?

601
01:12:14,897 --> 01:12:16,694
I need to know you're listening.

602
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:19,892
Okay?

603
01:12:34,550 --> 01:12:36,848
What the fuck are you doing?

604
01:12:37,286 --> 01:12:40,585
What is this place?
Where the fuck are we?

605
01:12:41,623 --> 01:12:43,318
Stuart!

606
01:12:45,027 --> 01:12:48,793
Remember when I said that
I didn't know what I was doing here?

607
01:12:50,733 --> 01:12:52,257
Well...

608
01:12:54,136 --> 01:12:56,297
...this is what I'm doing here.

609
01:12:59,341 --> 01:13:00,808
What is this place?

610
01:13:03,045 --> 01:13:04,808
This place....

611
01:13:06,148 --> 01:13:07,945
People come here....

612
01:13:09,718 --> 01:13:11,413
People come here to kill people.

613
01:13:13,021 --> 01:13:16,320
What? Who kills?

614
01:13:17,259 --> 01:13:19,227
Oh, my God, are they gonna kill us?

615
01:13:19,795 --> 01:13:20,989
Well...

616
01:13:22,464 --> 01:13:23,931
...not...

617
01:13:24,133 --> 01:13:25,361
...us.

618
01:13:26,668 --> 01:13:28,602
Oh, my God.

619
01:13:29,071 --> 01:13:31,266
Oh, my God. Are you gonna kill me?

620
01:13:31,473 --> 01:13:34,636
-You're gonna kill me!
-No. No, no! No, no, no.

621
01:13:34,843 --> 01:13:37,937
No. Jesus, no. No.

622
01:13:38,247 --> 01:13:40,545
Then what the fuck
are you doing here?

623
01:13:40,749 --> 01:13:42,307
What the fuck are you wearing?

624
01:13:42,518 --> 01:13:44,509
Someone brought me here...

625
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:46,449
...the same as you.

626
01:13:47,389 --> 01:13:49,084
Someone I know.

627
01:13:50,426 --> 01:13:51,859
Look...

628
01:13:52,094 --> 01:13:53,823
...he wanted me to--

629
01:13:54,029 --> 01:13:56,691
To do this with him.

630
01:13:57,299 --> 01:13:58,857
What?

631
01:13:59,301 --> 01:14:00,495
Stuart, please.

632
01:14:01,203 --> 01:14:03,364
Please just let me go.
Help me get out of this chair.

633
01:14:03,572 --> 01:14:07,702
Please. Please help me get out of this
chair. Get me out of this chair, please!

634
01:14:30,265 --> 01:14:33,666
You probably used that face to get
whatever the fuck you wanted.

635
01:14:34,169 --> 01:14:36,137
Fucking skank.

636
01:14:49,618 --> 01:14:51,984
Oh, that's fucking rich.

637
01:14:52,788 --> 01:14:55,120
You should see your fucking face.

638
01:14:59,061 --> 01:15:02,326
-We gotta get out of here.
-We can't.

639
01:15:03,065 --> 01:15:05,363
They think you're gonna kill me?

640
01:15:05,868 --> 01:15:08,063
You're not some monster.

641
01:15:09,805 --> 01:15:12,103
-I'm not that guy.
-No.

642
01:15:12,307 --> 01:15:13,535
No, I know.

643
01:15:13,742 --> 01:15:16,302
-I know you're a good person.
-I'm not that guy.

644
01:15:17,045 --> 01:15:19,138
I know. Of course not.

645
01:15:19,348 --> 01:15:21,111
I'm not that guy.

646
01:15:24,419 --> 01:15:27,718
-Okay. Okay.
-I'm not that guy.

647
01:15:30,626 --> 01:15:32,560
We're gonna get out of here.

648
01:15:39,434 --> 01:15:41,334
I'm not that guy.

649
01:15:45,941 --> 01:15:47,966
I'm not that guy.

650
01:15:50,979 --> 01:15:53,004
I'm not that guy.

651
01:15:54,116 --> 01:15:55,879
There must be a co--

652
01:16:18,707 --> 01:16:20,834
Oh, fuck. Fuck.

653
01:16:36,892 --> 01:16:39,554
Christ! Fuck!

654
01:16:40,362 --> 01:16:41,727
God!

655
01:16:43,832 --> 01:16:44,890
Fuck!

656
01:16:46,168 --> 01:16:49,467
Don't you have family?
Don't you have a wife?

657
01:16:50,339 --> 01:16:51,806
My wife?

658
01:16:52,007 --> 01:16:53,702
My wife?

659
01:16:55,944 --> 01:16:57,775
I'm not allowed to kill my wife.

660
01:17:18,233 --> 01:17:20,326
-Finish?
-Yeah, I'm finished, all right.

661
01:17:20,535 --> 01:17:23,402
Hey, hey! You cannot done.

662
01:17:23,605 --> 01:17:25,300
You go in room, finish.

663
01:17:26,041 --> 01:17:27,508
You know what? I am fucking done.

664
01:17:27,709 --> 01:17:30,177
If you don't like it, you can go in
and finish her yourself.

665
01:17:30,379 --> 01:17:32,973
You cannot leave unless
you complete. It's contract.

666
01:17:33,181 --> 01:17:34,808
I fucking paid!

667
01:17:35,017 --> 01:17:36,814
You have my money
and you can keep it!

668
01:17:37,019 --> 01:17:40,386
I am not going back in that room!
I'm done!

669
01:17:40,589 --> 01:17:42,454
Hey! Hey!

670
01:18:41,216 --> 01:18:43,582
Hello. Special offer.

671
01:18:43,785 --> 01:18:47,186
But she's only available
for the next 20 minutes.

672
01:18:47,422 --> 01:18:49,014
Do you want her?

673
01:18:53,895 --> 01:18:55,522
We'll let you know.

674
01:19:36,104 --> 01:19:37,731
Six-fifty.

675
01:19:56,858 --> 01:19:57,825
Yes?

676
01:19:58,360 --> 01:20:03,195
Apologies for interrupting you, but
we have special available right now.

677
01:20:03,398 --> 01:20:04,729
Very good price.

678
01:20:10,605 --> 01:20:12,402
Where's Todd?

679
01:20:24,719 --> 01:20:26,448
Problem with friend.

680
01:20:29,858 --> 01:20:32,156
May I borrow this
for a moment, please?

681
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:40,024
What do you think?

682
01:20:40,235 --> 01:20:41,930
Should I do it?

683
01:20:42,137 --> 01:20:44,367
I mean, I wouldn't pay
more than a grand for her...

684
01:20:44,573 --> 01:20:46,370
...in this kind of shape, but....

685
01:20:46,575 --> 01:20:48,440
I mean, look at that.

686
01:20:48,643 --> 01:20:50,508
She's not gonna last that long, huh?

687
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:54,880
You should see
what she did to my friend.

688
01:21:00,222 --> 01:21:01,621
I'll take her.

689
01:21:42,631 --> 01:21:44,895
A souvenir from your friend.

690
01:21:55,043 --> 01:21:57,102
Notice anything different about me?

691
01:21:59,848 --> 01:22:01,907
I bet you fucking do.

692
01:22:02,984 --> 01:22:04,781
Fucking bitch.

693
01:22:09,557 --> 01:22:11,684
Fucking respect me now.

694
01:22:13,561 --> 01:22:15,961
I don't fucking work for you!

695
01:22:17,132 --> 01:22:20,260
I don't work all fucking day
for you to humiliate me.

696
01:22:23,972 --> 01:22:25,132
To tell me I'm shit.

697
01:22:29,477 --> 01:22:30,910
Never fuck me.

698
01:22:32,314 --> 01:22:33,872
Look at you.

699
01:22:34,416 --> 01:22:35,713
What?

700
01:22:35,917 --> 01:22:38,909
What, you got something to say?
Do you? You do, bitch?

701
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:42,521
Yeah? Oh, good.
Well, it better be fucking good.

702
01:22:42,958 --> 01:22:46,450
-Let's fucking hear it. What?
-I'm not your wife.

703
01:22:46,661 --> 01:22:50,427
I'm not your wife, Stuart.
I'm not your wife.

704
01:22:51,466 --> 01:22:56,130
She doesn't understand you.
She doesn't understand you like I do.

705
01:22:56,338 --> 01:22:59,501
-And I see how you're strong.
-I am strong.

706
01:22:59,708 --> 01:23:02,438
-I am fucking Hercules!
-I see.

707
01:23:03,378 --> 01:23:05,938
I know. I know. I see it. I see it.

708
01:23:06,314 --> 01:23:07,713
I saw it last night.

709
01:23:07,916 --> 01:23:11,477
I was hoping you would kiss me.
I wanted you to kiss me.

710
01:23:13,254 --> 01:23:15,620
I thought about you all night.

711
01:23:22,664 --> 01:23:24,825
Get on the fucking floor.

712
01:23:34,809 --> 01:23:36,208
Are you scared?

713
01:23:39,180 --> 01:23:41,171
You fucking better be.

714
01:23:42,884 --> 01:23:44,442
I am.

715
01:23:45,353 --> 01:23:47,150
I like it.

716
01:24:01,269 --> 01:24:02,827
Look at me.

717
01:24:05,106 --> 01:24:06,471
Bitch.

718
01:24:07,842 --> 01:24:10,572
You fucking whore.

719
01:24:35,570 --> 01:24:37,401
Get in the chair!

720
01:24:37,605 --> 01:24:39,402
Get in the fucking chair!

721
01:24:43,611 --> 01:24:45,078
Fucker!

722
01:25:02,464 --> 01:25:03,431
What's the code?

723
01:25:03,765 --> 01:25:05,596
Fuck you!

724
01:25:09,704 --> 01:25:11,262
What's the fucking code?

725
01:25:14,909 --> 01:25:16,672
-Your birthday.
-What?

726
01:25:16,878 --> 01:25:18,675
What is your birthday?

727
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:20,814
December 1 2th.

728
01:25:22,484 --> 01:25:25,112
Oh, that is fucking sick.

729
01:25:41,903 --> 01:25:43,336
What the fuck? It's not opening.

730
01:25:45,140 --> 01:25:47,836
It's not fucking opening!

731
01:25:48,042 --> 01:25:49,907
Oh, yes, it is.

732
01:25:51,179 --> 01:25:54,205
Do it! She's right up there
behind you! Kill her!

733
01:25:54,415 --> 01:25:57,213
Motherfucker! Shoot her!

734
01:25:57,552 --> 01:25:59,952
Kill her! Kill her!

735
01:26:03,224 --> 01:26:04,953
Don't shoot!
Be careful, for God's sakes!

736
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:07,151
She'll cut! She'll fucking cut!
Don't shoot!

737
01:26:07,362 --> 01:26:08,693
Fucking she'll cut! She'll cut!

738
01:26:09,931 --> 01:26:11,262
Get Sasha!

739
01:26:11,499 --> 01:26:15,367
You gotta do it! I'm the fucking
customer here! Do it, for fuck's sake.

740
01:26:15,570 --> 01:26:17,401
Jesus fucking Christ. Oh, shit!

741
01:26:17,605 --> 01:26:18,663
-Sasha!
-Get him!

742
01:26:36,524 --> 01:26:38,424
-Wait! I wanna buy my way out of here.
-Wait!

743
01:26:41,796 --> 01:26:44,788
-You can't afford it.
-Don't tell me what I can't afford.

744
01:26:44,999 --> 01:26:49,163
There's nothing I can't afford. I could
buy and sell everyone in this room.

745
01:26:50,305 --> 01:26:52,500
You going to call your parents
for money?

746
01:26:52,707 --> 01:26:54,800
No, motherfucker, it's my money.

747
01:26:55,009 --> 01:26:58,001
Just get me a PDA, a SWlFT number
and a recipient name.

748
01:26:58,213 --> 01:27:01,080
I have accounts in Switzerland,
Luxembourg and the lsle of Man.

749
01:27:01,282 --> 01:27:05,343
Just name your fucking price!
Trust me, I got it.

750
01:27:07,222 --> 01:27:08,746
Okay.

751
01:27:14,295 --> 01:27:15,421
We negotiate.

752
01:27:16,698 --> 01:27:19,531
-This is bullshit!
-This is business.

753
01:27:19,834 --> 01:27:20,892
I'll pay more!

754
01:27:21,336 --> 01:27:23,304
Not with a second mortgage
on your house...

755
01:27:23,504 --> 01:27:25,563
...and your daughter's
private-school tuition.

756
01:27:26,040 --> 01:27:27,735
That's why your friend pay.

757
01:27:27,942 --> 01:27:29,807
What's the number?

758
01:27:30,945 --> 01:27:33,345
Money is not the only issue.

759
01:27:33,548 --> 01:27:35,175
We have contract here.

760
01:27:35,984 --> 01:27:37,417
What kind of contract?

761
01:27:38,886 --> 01:27:41,514
Anyone who come to this place...

762
01:27:41,723 --> 01:27:43,350
...cannot leave...

763
01:27:43,558 --> 01:27:45,116
...without killing.

764
01:27:46,060 --> 01:27:49,587
They're still gonna kill you,
you fucking stupid cunt.

765
01:27:50,999 --> 01:27:52,728
What did you say to me?

766
01:27:54,669 --> 01:27:57,467
You're a stupid fucking cu--!

767
01:28:14,355 --> 01:28:15,720
Let him bleed to death.

768
01:28:17,492 --> 01:28:18,516
Misha, no!

769
01:28:59,133 --> 01:29:01,067
Isn't this great?

770
01:29:07,408 --> 01:29:09,672
Hey, get back here!

771
01:29:11,846 --> 01:29:13,040
Wait!

772
01:29:13,247 --> 01:29:15,147
Wait! Wait!

773
01:29:16,918 --> 01:29:18,010
Wait!

774
01:29:19,153 --> 01:29:20,120
Hey!

775
01:29:20,555 --> 01:29:23,149
You fucking shit! Wait!

776
01:34:25,226 --> 01:34:27,126
Bitches!
