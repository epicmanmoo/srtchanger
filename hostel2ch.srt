1
00:03:28,494 --> 00:03:31,520
He say, "Good morning,"
and ask, "How is your hand?"

2
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:35,188
It's-- It's better.

3
00:03:35,434 --> 00:03:36,628
What's left of it.

4
00:03:39,672 --> 00:03:41,105
Sorry.

5
00:03:41,373 --> 00:03:44,137
We would like to speak with you
if you feel well enough.

6
00:03:44,343 --> 00:03:46,470
Yeah, that's all right.

7
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:51,074
-Coffee?
-No, thank you.

8
00:03:53,986 --> 00:03:57,353
Tell us about this place you mention,
in Slovakia.

9
00:03:58,657 --> 00:04:00,488
It's this....

10
00:04:01,393 --> 00:04:03,258
It's some kind of factory...

11
00:04:03,829 --> 00:04:06,297
,,,where these people,
these very rich people,,,

12
00:04:06,499 --> 00:04:09,559
,,,they pay to torture and kill kids,

13
00:04:10,102 --> 00:04:11,797
Mostly backpackers,

14
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:16,872
And they killed two of my friends.

15
00:04:32,892 --> 00:04:34,484
They take you from this hostel...

16
00:04:35,561 --> 00:04:38,189
,,,and they bring you
to this factory and,,,,

17
00:04:39,798 --> 00:04:42,562
I went there looking for Josh,

18
00:04:42,768 --> 00:04:47,205
He was one of my friends
and they took him there and....

19
00:04:49,942 --> 00:04:51,773
And they,,,,

20
00:04:51,977 --> 00:04:52,944
They killed him,

21
00:04:56,615 --> 00:04:58,310
It was horrible.

22
00:05:10,095 --> 00:05:11,824
He ask how you survive.

23
00:05:16,335 --> 00:05:17,302
I....

24
00:05:26,345 --> 00:05:28,245
I escaped.

25
00:05:39,158 --> 00:05:41,251
Who organize this place?

26
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:46,830
I don't know.
It's some kind of hunting club. They....

27
00:05:47,366 --> 00:05:50,426
They all have the same tattoo.

28
00:05:50,636 --> 00:05:51,728
It's a dog,

29
00:05:51,937 --> 00:05:53,461
It's a bloodhound dog,

30
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,745
Strange that you mention this tattoo.

31
00:06:12,091 --> 00:06:13,149
Why?

32
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:26,703
Because someone was found dead
in a train station bathroom in Vienna...

33
00:06:26,905 --> 00:06:29,305
...with this same bloodhound tattoo
you describe.

34
00:06:36,682 --> 00:06:40,812
Security tapes from this station
show him entering from a platform...

35
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:45,150
...where a train arrive earlier that day
from Slovakia.

36
00:06:45,357 --> 00:06:47,848
It came through
the same station in Vienna.

37
00:06:52,364 --> 00:06:54,332
You were on that tape.

38
00:07:00,172 --> 00:07:03,972
Did his tattoo look something like this?

39
00:07:04,476 --> 00:07:06,103
What the fuck's going on?

40
00:07:06,312 --> 00:07:08,507
Help! Somebody help me!

41
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,386
Jesus.

42
00:07:33,939 --> 00:07:35,497
You hungry?

43
00:07:35,974 --> 00:07:37,999
It's 3:1 5 in the morning.

44
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:40,906
I have to take these with food.
I wanna know if you want anything.

45
00:07:41,146 --> 00:07:44,047
Yeah, I want you to talk to someone.

46
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:47,143
When are you gonna tell
Josh's mother what happened?

47
00:07:47,353 --> 00:07:48,650
I'm not.

48
00:07:50,989 --> 00:07:52,820
She still thinks her son's in Europe.

49
00:07:53,025 --> 00:07:55,289
What the fuck
am I supposed to tell her?

50
00:07:55,494 --> 00:07:58,520
-She'll go straight to the police.
-Yeah, exactly. Someone should.

51
00:07:58,731 --> 00:08:02,861
No, no one should. You don't get it.
These people are tied into everyone.

52
00:08:03,068 --> 00:08:04,501
Somebody starts asking questions...

53
00:08:04,703 --> 00:08:06,568
...they're gonna come after me
and find me.

54
00:08:06,972 --> 00:08:10,806
At my grandmother's house? I've
been coming here since I was a kid.

55
00:08:11,009 --> 00:08:13,807
I can barely find the place.
I had to ask my sister for directions.

56
00:08:14,012 --> 00:08:16,037
-You told your sister we were here?
-Yeah. So?

57
00:08:16,248 --> 00:08:18,739
-Well, who else knows?
-No one!

58
00:08:18,951 --> 00:08:20,418
Jesus.

59
00:08:21,553 --> 00:08:24,044
I'm doing this for your protection too.
You know that, right?

60
00:08:24,256 --> 00:08:26,588
Oh, Paxton....

61
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:29,916
Look.

62
00:08:30,529 --> 00:08:32,929
I took you back because I felt bad.

63
00:08:33,465 --> 00:08:35,865
But you're going crazy.

64
00:08:36,068 --> 00:08:39,526
You wake up every night screaming,
and I can't sleep.

65
00:08:39,738 --> 00:08:41,330
Well, that won't
be a problem anymore.

66
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:43,167
Paxton, that's not what l--

67
00:08:44,143 --> 00:08:46,509
Oh, fuck.

68
00:09:16,842 --> 00:09:18,503
Morning!

69
00:09:37,529 --> 00:09:39,360
Paxton?

70
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:49,768
Hey.

71
00:11:09,054 --> 00:11:10,521
Lorna?

72
00:11:10,822 --> 00:11:12,380
Lorna?

73
00:11:14,693 --> 00:11:18,094
Sorry. I was trying to be
in the moment.

74
00:11:18,297 --> 00:11:20,265
Absorb.

75
00:11:25,637 --> 00:11:28,731
Do you think she ever saw a cock
before this class?

76
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:31,236
If she did, it was in a Botticelli.

77
00:11:31,443 --> 00:11:32,705
Oh, my God.

78
00:11:32,911 --> 00:11:36,779
If I hear her talk about how emotional
the Botticelllis are one more time...

79
00:11:36,982 --> 00:11:39,746
...I swear to God,
I'm gonna choke the bitch to death.

80
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:49,991
Until Tuesday.

81
00:11:50,195 --> 00:11:51,594
Are you all packed for Prague?

82
00:11:51,797 --> 00:11:54,197
-Jeans. No heels.
-Awesome.

83
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,890
I can't do it on the cobblestone.
I don't know how you do it.

84
00:11:57,102 --> 00:11:59,195
I can teach you if you bring heels.

85
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:06,075
Axelle.

86
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,951
Hands on your pencils, boys.

87
00:12:32,638 --> 00:12:34,970
-Would he ever?
-Excuse me, girls.

88
00:12:35,173 --> 00:12:36,470
-Excuse me. Hi.
-Hi.

89
00:12:36,675 --> 00:12:39,371
-May I see?
-Oh, they're just rough.

90
00:12:39,578 --> 00:12:42,103
Show her. Don't be shy.

91
00:12:45,717 --> 00:12:47,014
That's the one of you.

92
00:12:47,252 --> 00:12:50,619
-Oh, wow, that's beautiful.
-Thanks.

93
00:12:50,822 --> 00:12:52,312
How much would you want for it?

94
00:12:52,524 --> 00:12:54,458
I wouldn't sell them.
You can have this one.

95
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,150
-Really?
-Yeah.

96
00:12:56,361 --> 00:12:59,626
-Oh, my God, thank you so much.
-You're welcome.

97
00:12:59,831 --> 00:13:02,026
Can I buy you a drink or something?

98
00:13:02,234 --> 00:13:05,670
Oh, I'm actually late. We're
catching a train to Prague, but....

99
00:13:05,871 --> 00:13:08,203
-I don't know. Maybe some other time.
-Okay.

100
00:13:08,407 --> 00:13:10,238
-Yeah! Okay.
-Okay.

101
00:13:10,442 --> 00:13:13,843
-I'll see you.
-All right. Bye. Thanks.

102
00:13:22,187 --> 00:13:24,519
No, Dad. It's Prague.
We're gonna be fine.

103
00:13:24,723 --> 00:13:26,588
It's not the Ukraine.

104
00:13:29,027 --> 00:13:30,494
No.

105
00:13:32,464 --> 00:13:34,796
No, Dad,
do not book the Four Seasons.

106
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,433
Book it, bitch. Book it. Please!

107
00:13:36,635 --> 00:13:40,594
Because, Dad, no college students
are staying at the Four Seasons.

108
00:13:40,806 --> 00:13:45,402
And, you know, it's for old people.
So thank you, but please don't.

109
00:13:46,178 --> 00:13:47,543
What?

110
00:13:50,682 --> 00:13:53,082
Yeah. Yes, we have chaperones.

111
00:13:53,285 --> 00:13:55,116
Okay, love you. Bye.

112
00:13:55,587 --> 00:13:58,249
Jesus, I hate that he calls
every fucking five minutes.

113
00:13:58,457 --> 00:14:01,620
-All right, let's go.
-Hold on. We gotta wait for someone.

114
00:14:02,227 --> 00:14:03,558
Who?

115
00:14:06,665 --> 00:14:07,689
-Yeah.
-No.

116
00:14:07,899 --> 00:14:08,957
-Yeah.
-No.

117
00:14:09,167 --> 00:14:11,795
She cornered me in the apartment.
She's homesick, crying.

118
00:14:12,003 --> 00:14:13,630
I felt bad. What am I supposed to say?

119
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:17,036
She's homesick for Baltimore?
We're in Rome, for fuck's sake.

120
00:14:17,242 --> 00:14:18,869
She's not that bad.

121
00:14:34,993 --> 00:14:37,086
Wow, is that a new journal
you got there?

122
00:14:37,963 --> 00:14:40,090
Yeah. It's a travel journal.

123
00:14:40,298 --> 00:14:41,822
For emotional callbacks.

124
00:14:42,801 --> 00:14:43,995
Of course.

125
00:14:45,504 --> 00:14:47,438
Lorna, we're gonna grab a drink.
You wanna go?

126
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,605
I'm okay. Thank you.

127
00:14:50,509 --> 00:14:53,774
All right.
Well, we'll see you in a little bit. Okay.

128
00:14:55,347 --> 00:14:56,507
Knock yourself out, buddy.

129
00:14:56,782 --> 00:14:58,306
See you later.

130
00:15:10,228 --> 00:15:13,129
Excuse you. Asshole.

131
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:26,471
She's like a 20-year-old grandmother.

132
00:15:26,678 --> 00:15:28,771
Whatever. She'll watch our stuff.
She's happy there.

133
00:15:29,147 --> 00:15:31,274
That's what she likes to do.

134
00:15:31,483 --> 00:15:32,882
Oh, we didn't order these.

135
00:15:33,084 --> 00:15:34,881
They're from girl.

136
00:15:38,156 --> 00:15:40,215
Whoa, your girlfriend's stalking us.

137
00:15:41,827 --> 00:15:43,522
Hey. What are you doing?

138
00:15:43,995 --> 00:15:46,156
You inspired me to take a trip.

139
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:57,001
Watch this.

140
00:15:59,945 --> 00:16:01,936
You've got to be kidding me.

141
00:16:02,314 --> 00:16:03,576
Hello. What's your name?

142
00:16:11,623 --> 00:16:15,252
Do you know where we could score,
like, party favors?

143
00:16:15,894 --> 00:16:16,986
What do you need?

144
00:16:17,195 --> 00:16:20,358
I don't know.
Like, bud and ecstasy and, like....

145
00:16:21,867 --> 00:16:23,198
PCP?

146
00:16:23,401 --> 00:16:25,699
Ice? Peyote? Crank?

147
00:16:25,904 --> 00:16:28,065
Okay, okay, bud and X are good.

148
00:16:30,475 --> 00:16:31,840
Sure.

149
00:16:32,911 --> 00:16:36,438
We go back to my car. I got some.

150
00:16:36,815 --> 00:16:38,043
Yeah?

151
00:16:39,384 --> 00:16:41,614
-Yeah?
-Okay.

152
00:16:51,897 --> 00:16:54,593
Fuck. You know what?

153
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:59,131
I'm trying but I can't find them.
Just hang on, yeah?

154
00:17:04,075 --> 00:17:06,908
-You want drink?
-No, I'm fine.

155
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:18,147
Hey, you know what?

156
00:17:18,356 --> 00:17:21,484
It's okay because we can just get
it at the club when we go to Prague.

157
00:17:21,693 --> 00:17:23,627
No, stay.

158
00:17:25,363 --> 00:17:27,888
I find them. Okay?

159
00:17:33,338 --> 00:17:35,329
You smell nice.

160
00:17:37,609 --> 00:17:40,237
-Whit, we gotta go. Lorna's waiting.
-Yeah, we have our friend.

161
00:17:40,445 --> 00:17:41,776
-You have friend?
-Yeah.

162
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:45,313
One, two, three, perfetto, Otherwise,
we have to take turns, huh?

163
00:17:48,887 --> 00:17:50,650
You know, we're gonna go,
so never mind.

164
00:17:50,855 --> 00:17:55,155
Where you go? I knew you were
a tease, you fucking cunt.

165
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,657
What the fuck did you call me?

166
00:17:56,861 --> 00:17:59,659
I called you
stupid fucking American cunt!

167
00:17:59,864 --> 00:18:01,024
-Fuck you!
-You know what?

168
00:18:01,232 --> 00:18:04,724
The train to fucking Prague
is long, you bitch.

169
00:18:04,936 --> 00:18:06,631
We'll come see you.

170
00:18:07,272 --> 00:18:08,705
Are you fucking insane?

171
00:18:08,907 --> 00:18:10,272
What? I fucking hate that word.

172
00:18:10,475 --> 00:18:12,807
"Oh, you stupid American cunt."
I fucking lost my temper.

173
00:18:13,011 --> 00:18:15,275
Okay, but it's not like
we're on campus and you can...

174
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:18,074
...call the dean
and file a report or something.

175
00:18:23,088 --> 00:18:25,283
Oh, my God. Lorna, what happened?

176
00:18:25,724 --> 00:18:27,658
Some guy took my iPod.

177
00:18:27,859 --> 00:18:29,053
What?

178
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:32,058
Is there, like, a police officer
on the train or something?

179
00:18:32,564 --> 00:18:34,759
-Yeah. I'll go check.
-Okay.

180
00:18:36,601 --> 00:18:37,863
It had everything.

181
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:41,571
That's awful. I'm so sorry.

182
00:18:43,241 --> 00:18:44,936
I'm sorry.

183
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,538
Here you go.

184
00:19:04,929 --> 00:19:06,487
It's those fucking guys.

185
00:19:06,698 --> 00:19:09,792
The fucking guys, the ltalian guys
from the room down the hall.

186
00:19:10,535 --> 00:19:12,696
-What do we do?
-Just be quiet.

187
00:19:21,446 --> 00:19:22,470
-Hi.
-Hi.

188
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:25,012
Excuse me.
Did one of you girls lose this?

189
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:27,215
Oh, my God!

190
00:19:27,886 --> 00:19:29,649
How did you know this was mine?

191
00:19:29,854 --> 00:19:33,051
I saw some guy run out of your room.
He tried to take my bag.

192
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:35,858
I fought him off
and this felled out of his pocket.

193
00:19:36,394 --> 00:19:38,794
I'm a little worried he might
come back looking for me.

194
00:19:38,997 --> 00:19:41,465
Well, do you wanna come in here
and hang out with us?

195
00:19:41,699 --> 00:19:43,530
-Really?
-Yeah, we have an extra seat.

196
00:19:43,735 --> 00:19:44,861
-Yeah, come in.
-Totally.

197
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:46,230
Thank you.

198
00:19:49,207 --> 00:19:50,834
I think...

199
00:19:51,042 --> 00:19:52,907
...we all need a little of this.

200
00:19:53,878 --> 00:19:55,311
Oh, awesome.

201
00:19:56,714 --> 00:19:58,875
Oh, no, thanks. I don't drink.

202
00:19:59,417 --> 00:20:01,009
Thank you.

203
00:20:01,319 --> 00:20:03,719
As my father always says:

204
00:20:03,955 --> 00:20:06,150
"Nazdrovia." To your health.

205
00:20:19,604 --> 00:20:22,334
So are you going to Prague
for the football match?

206
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:24,337
I kind of wanna go home.

207
00:20:24,542 --> 00:20:29,002
Oh, I don't blame you. I got
robbed twice on the overnight train.

208
00:20:29,214 --> 00:20:31,079
There are so few safe places
left in Europe.

209
00:20:31,716 --> 00:20:32,978
So where are you going?

210
00:20:34,085 --> 00:20:35,643
On a little spa vacation.

211
00:20:36,187 --> 00:20:37,154
Where?

212
00:20:37,689 --> 00:20:38,917
Slovakia.

213
00:20:39,124 --> 00:20:41,354
Wait, wasn't there, like,
some war in Slovakia?

214
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:45,691
There hasn't been war in Slovakia
for 50 years.

215
00:20:45,897 --> 00:20:47,125
That's Bosnia, darling.

216
00:20:47,332 --> 00:20:49,630
-Oh, like you knew.
-I did so.

217
00:20:49,834 --> 00:20:51,358
What are the spas like there?

218
00:20:51,569 --> 00:20:55,198
They're the best natural hot springs
in the world.

219
00:20:55,406 --> 00:20:59,467
I go twice a year. It's great to get away
from the ltalian guys.

220
00:20:59,677 --> 00:21:01,008
They get to be a bit much.

221
00:21:02,213 --> 00:21:04,204
Wow, hot springs?

222
00:21:04,415 --> 00:21:07,782
That sounds so therapeutic.
I wanna go.

223
00:21:07,986 --> 00:21:11,513
It's very easy. You just have to
switch trains in Prague.

224
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:14,920
It could be nice.

225
00:21:15,226 --> 00:21:19,686
You know? I had enough gross guys
for one weekend.

226
00:21:20,832 --> 00:21:22,697
Okay, we'll go.

227
00:21:27,272 --> 00:21:28,864
Do you know of a good place to stay?

228
00:21:30,241 --> 00:21:35,235
-Smart move with the shoes.
-What? It's so easy. You have to try it.

229
00:22:03,541 --> 00:22:05,839
Hi. Can I help you?

230
00:22:06,044 --> 00:22:08,535
-I need a room for my friends, please.
-Yeah, cool.

231
00:22:08,746 --> 00:22:10,737
Your passports, please.

232
00:22:14,652 --> 00:22:16,745
American. Good.

233
00:22:16,955 --> 00:22:19,685
Yeah, cool. It's 1 0 Euros for night.

234
00:22:21,392 --> 00:22:22,950
No. I got this one.

235
00:22:23,161 --> 00:22:24,423
No. It's on me.

236
00:22:24,629 --> 00:22:26,893
-Thank you.
-Money.

237
00:22:27,265 --> 00:22:28,892
Thanks.

238
00:22:31,269 --> 00:22:32,634
Here are your keys.

239
00:22:34,205 --> 00:22:37,800
And this is a notice for
the harvest fair tonight, girls.

240
00:22:38,009 --> 00:22:40,842
Will be sexy good times. Come on.

241
00:22:41,045 --> 00:22:43,878
It's Dozinky, I know that.
They have it every year.

242
00:22:44,282 --> 00:22:47,774
-Yeah.
-Lots of music, dancing, costumes.

243
00:22:47,986 --> 00:22:50,045
Oh, my gosh! Could we go?

244
00:22:51,723 --> 00:22:54,214
-lt sounds kind of gay.
-Excuse me.

245
00:23:00,565 --> 00:23:02,897
Oh, we are so going to
the harvest festival.

246
00:23:03,101 --> 00:23:06,434
-Come on. This way.
-Thank you.

247
00:23:07,005 --> 00:23:08,939
You're welcome.

248
00:23:11,843 --> 00:23:14,710
Do you think they have any frescoes
in the room?

249
00:23:36,501 --> 00:23:39,436
Wow, this room feels so timeless.

250
00:23:39,637 --> 00:23:41,537
Are you kidding right now?

251
00:23:44,742 --> 00:23:45,766
Oh, my God!

252
00:23:47,111 --> 00:23:48,874
Sexy.

253
00:23:50,214 --> 00:23:51,613
Come here,

254
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,770
Yes! Yes!

255
00:26:04,115 --> 00:26:05,742
Yeah!

256
00:26:06,551 --> 00:26:08,178
That's what I'm talking about, huh?

257
00:26:30,775 --> 00:26:32,470
Todd, what's up?

258
00:26:33,845 --> 00:26:36,837
Yeah, nothing.
We're just finishing up breakfast.

259
00:26:39,383 --> 00:26:40,748
Really?

260
00:26:44,322 --> 00:26:46,222
Wow, I didn't think--

261
00:26:47,859 --> 00:26:50,259
Jesus. You sure?

262
00:26:51,362 --> 00:26:56,425
Yeah, yeah, okay. I can go right now.
I'll tell her I have to meet a client.

263
00:26:57,201 --> 00:26:58,793
Okay.

264
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:00,897
See you.

265
00:27:10,147 --> 00:27:13,275
No respect for me,
No respect for mother earth,

266
00:27:13,484 --> 00:27:16,351
Well, don't you have
anything to say for yourself?

267
00:27:18,155 --> 00:27:20,623
Well, that's just fine,
We can all ride home in silence,

268
00:27:28,132 --> 00:27:31,863
Gosh! This village is so enchanting.

269
00:27:32,336 --> 00:27:34,702
Lorna, are you having a
"journal-gasm" right now?

270
00:27:34,906 --> 00:27:36,931
Actually, yes. Multiple ones.

271
00:27:37,141 --> 00:27:40,167
I get to write about
how beautiful this village is...

272
00:27:40,378 --> 00:27:42,869
...and I get to write about
what a raving bitch you are.

273
00:27:45,483 --> 00:27:47,451
She comes back swinging!

274
00:27:47,652 --> 00:27:50,348
-Well-played.
-Thank you.

275
00:27:53,624 --> 00:27:54,591
Dollar!

276
00:27:55,326 --> 00:27:56,384
Dollar!

277
00:27:56,827 --> 00:27:58,590
Do you guys have a dollar?

278
00:27:58,796 --> 00:28:01,196
-I got it.
-Oh, no, no, no.

279
00:28:01,399 --> 00:28:04,334
No, no, no. I got it. I got it.
Let me.

280
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:10,874
I have Smints.

281
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:14,539
Would you like a Smint?

282
00:28:27,124 --> 00:28:28,819
Bitches!

283
00:28:35,466 --> 00:28:37,593
Welcome to Slovakia.

284
00:28:45,643 --> 00:28:49,170
You both have corner suites
with views of the river.

285
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:51,439
Here are your pagers.

286
00:28:51,649 --> 00:28:54,413
Perfect. Thank you.

287
00:28:56,587 --> 00:28:59,317
-You ready to do this?
-Yeah, I'm ready.

288
00:29:00,091 --> 00:29:01,490
Really?

289
00:29:01,692 --> 00:29:04,160
Because you look like
your dog just died.

290
00:29:04,362 --> 00:29:07,058
I'm just jet-lagged, man.
I'll take a shower and I'll feel better.

291
00:29:07,264 --> 00:29:09,494
-All right.
-Thanks.

292
00:29:13,304 --> 00:29:15,602
Oh, my God!

293
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:14,595
Hey, guys!

294
00:30:15,066 --> 00:30:16,090
Yes?

295
00:30:16,567 --> 00:30:18,194
For the apartment.

296
00:30:18,502 --> 00:30:20,436
Awesome, dude.

297
00:30:20,638 --> 00:30:23,334
Those swords are like 1 000 Euros.

298
00:30:23,541 --> 00:30:25,668
Trust me, she can afford it.

299
00:30:26,644 --> 00:30:29,545
Does she get, like,
a really big allowance?

300
00:30:29,847 --> 00:30:32,213
No, it's more like an inheritance.

301
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:36,344
Her mom died when she was 1 2 and,
like, left her everything.

302
00:30:36,554 --> 00:30:38,419
And so she keeps her dad
on an allowance.

303
00:30:39,757 --> 00:30:41,349
-Really?
-Yeah.

304
00:30:42,526 --> 00:30:45,757
She could pretty much buy Slovakia
if she wanted to.

305
00:30:48,099 --> 00:30:50,659
Yeah. It's pretty rad.

306
00:31:17,728 --> 00:31:19,286
Yeah!

307
00:31:20,431 --> 00:31:22,296
Badass.

308
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,560
Let me see this motherfucker.

309
00:31:30,641 --> 00:31:32,336
You're up, bro.

310
00:31:35,913 --> 00:31:38,848
I think I'm gonna pass on the tattoo.

311
00:31:39,083 --> 00:31:40,482
Come on, man, sit down.

312
00:31:40,684 --> 00:31:44,051
A tattoo's not really me.
It's not my style.

313
00:31:44,255 --> 00:31:48,055
I didn't know and I don't like needles.
I don't like needles very much.

314
00:31:48,259 --> 00:31:50,750
Dude, what are you doing? Sit down.

315
00:31:50,961 --> 00:31:53,862
Here's the problem. Linda. What
is she gonna say when she sees this?

316
00:31:54,064 --> 00:31:57,465
My wife is not gonna
really understand.

317
00:31:57,668 --> 00:32:00,136
Is there some other option?

318
00:32:00,905 --> 00:32:03,499
Everyone must get tattooed.
Part of contract.

319
00:32:03,874 --> 00:32:04,841
Yeah.

320
00:32:05,075 --> 00:32:06,269
Let's do it. Come on, man.

321
00:32:06,477 --> 00:32:08,502
Why don't you sit down?
These guys aren't playing.

322
00:32:08,813 --> 00:32:11,373
A tattoo is
a little difficult to explain, Todd.

323
00:32:11,582 --> 00:32:13,573
Didn't seem like you had
any problem explaining...

324
00:32:13,784 --> 00:32:16,116
...the gonorrhea you brought back
from Thailand.

325
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,811
Can't believe you're bringing up
the gonorrhea. Every time--

326
00:32:19,824 --> 00:32:21,189
Is there any problem here?

327
00:32:21,392 --> 00:32:24,850
No, no. I just didn't know
that this was part of it.

328
00:32:28,465 --> 00:32:29,864
Stuart.

329
00:32:30,067 --> 00:32:34,868
This is not like going to a whorehouse.
You can't just back out.

330
00:32:40,744 --> 00:32:43,542
Get in the fucking chair.

331
00:32:50,221 --> 00:32:51,813
Yeah.

332
00:32:53,891 --> 00:32:56,485
Come on, man. Look at this.

333
00:32:56,927 --> 00:32:59,122
I'm fucking proud of mine.

334
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:18,580
Look what I found!

335
00:33:19,116 --> 00:33:22,779
Okay, and before you say anything,
it's cider, it's non-alcoholic...

336
00:33:22,987 --> 00:33:25,148
...and those little kids right there
made it.

337
00:33:25,356 --> 00:33:27,017
-Oh, my gosh, really?
-Yeah.

338
00:33:27,224 --> 00:33:29,158
-I'm gonna go say thank you.
-Okay.

339
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,760
They don't speak much English.

340
00:33:34,298 --> 00:33:38,667
This is quite possibly the most
alcoholic cider I've ever tasted.

341
00:33:38,969 --> 00:33:40,596
Come on, it's good for her.
She needs it.

342
00:33:40,804 --> 00:33:42,362
Thank you.

343
00:33:43,908 --> 00:33:44,875
Well, cheers.

344
00:33:50,314 --> 00:33:52,043
Oh, my God, my song! Let's go!

345
00:33:53,751 --> 00:33:54,945
Come!

346
00:33:59,657 --> 00:34:02,057
Come on, Borat.
Let's see what you got.

347
00:34:22,313 --> 00:34:23,837
There they are.

348
00:34:24,048 --> 00:34:25,174
Three o'clock.

349
00:34:25,683 --> 00:34:27,344
-Jesus.
-Right?

350
00:34:27,551 --> 00:34:29,781
It's fucking crazy, huh?
Dead ringer.

351
00:34:29,987 --> 00:34:32,387
Happy fucking birthday, bro.

352
00:34:36,026 --> 00:34:39,359
-Dude, where you going?
-ln for a better look.

353
00:35:05,189 --> 00:35:06,156
Me?

354
00:35:47,664 --> 00:35:49,131
Hi.

355
00:35:49,867 --> 00:35:50,993
Hi.

356
00:35:51,235 --> 00:35:54,864
Would you like to dance with me?

357
00:35:56,407 --> 00:35:58,307
No, thank you. I'm--

358
00:35:58,509 --> 00:35:59,942
I'm not nearly drunk enough.

359
00:36:00,144 --> 00:36:01,634
Come on. I'll show you how.

360
00:36:01,845 --> 00:36:03,972
No, really. It's easy.

361
00:36:05,949 --> 00:36:10,249
No. Thank you, really, but my feet.
I'm tired.

362
00:36:13,323 --> 00:36:15,484
I could have helped you.

363
00:36:17,227 --> 00:36:19,024
Excuse me?

364
00:36:26,136 --> 00:36:27,103
Hey.

365
00:36:28,205 --> 00:36:29,433
Hey.

366
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:32,268
That guy make you some troubles?

367
00:36:32,543 --> 00:36:34,943
No. He's fine.

368
00:36:36,647 --> 00:36:38,877
What he say to you?

369
00:36:40,384 --> 00:36:42,614
Nothing. He just wanted to dance.

370
00:36:44,488 --> 00:36:47,048
He won't bother you anymore.

371
00:36:47,991 --> 00:36:50,186
Oh, he wasn't bothering me.

372
00:36:54,331 --> 00:36:56,993
Here. Take a drink.

373
00:37:04,475 --> 00:37:07,672
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

374
00:37:14,418 --> 00:37:16,215
-Oh, I'm so sorry!
-Don't worry about it.

375
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:18,388
I'm so, so sorry. I'm such an idiot.

376
00:37:18,589 --> 00:37:20,113
No, it's all right.

377
00:37:20,591 --> 00:37:23,287
-Here, let me get you a drink.
-No, you don't need to.

378
00:37:23,494 --> 00:37:24,825
-No, I insist.
-No, no.

379
00:37:25,028 --> 00:37:26,757
I insist.

380
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:38,034
Beth! Beth!

381
00:37:38,242 --> 00:37:41,678
Beth! Oh, my God, Roman wants to
take me on a boat ride...

382
00:37:41,879 --> 00:37:43,813
...and he's just so suave
and he's amazing...

383
00:37:44,014 --> 00:37:46,744
...and he doesn't speak English,
but we understand each other.

384
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:51,887
Yeah. Just promise me you won't
go on a boat ride with him, okay?

385
00:37:52,089 --> 00:37:53,386
Why not?

386
00:37:53,624 --> 00:37:55,455
What's the big deal?
You don't fancy him?

387
00:37:55,659 --> 00:37:59,254
Just because he's not "Whitney
approved" or "Beth approved" looking?

388
00:37:59,463 --> 00:38:02,762
No, I'm not saying that at all. I just
want you to stay here where it's safe...

389
00:38:02,966 --> 00:38:04,797
...we're all together,
we don't get separated.

390
00:38:05,002 --> 00:38:07,232
Just promise me
you won't go on a boat ride with him.

391
00:38:14,711 --> 00:38:19,171
Lorna, promise me
you won't go on a boat ride with him.

392
00:38:20,317 --> 00:38:24,048
Beth. It's okay.

393
00:38:24,254 --> 00:38:26,552
-Okay. You promise?
-Okay, okay, okay.

394
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:28,389
Okay.

395
00:38:29,793 --> 00:38:31,488
Roman.

396
00:38:32,262 --> 00:38:34,230
Okay, two, please.

397
00:38:36,033 --> 00:38:39,662
-Here you go. I'm so sorry about that.
-It's okay.

398
00:38:39,870 --> 00:38:42,236
-Cheers.
-Cheers. Thanks.

399
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:49,936
So, what brings you
to this corner of the world?

400
00:38:50,814 --> 00:38:53,544
Her. Firestarter.

401
00:38:54,751 --> 00:38:56,241
And you?

402
00:38:58,722 --> 00:39:00,883
I honestly don't know.

403
00:39:03,827 --> 00:39:06,421
I'm sorry, there's probably...

404
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:09,565
...a small army of Slovak boys
all fighting over you.

405
00:39:09,766 --> 00:39:13,395
Why travel all this way
just to talk with an ugly American?

406
00:39:13,604 --> 00:39:15,595
You're not that ugly.

407
00:39:15,806 --> 00:39:17,330
Really?

408
00:39:18,575 --> 00:39:20,133
Well, cheers to that.

409
00:39:20,344 --> 00:39:21,834
Cheers.

410
00:39:22,746 --> 00:39:24,805
Hey, your friend looks like
she's having fun.

411
00:39:26,216 --> 00:39:27,376
Yeah.

412
00:39:27,584 --> 00:39:29,984
I get to listen to them have sex later.

413
00:39:31,688 --> 00:39:34,213
Can we switch?
I'm over at the Dvorzak hotel and...

414
00:39:34,591 --> 00:39:38,254
...it's probably been three centuries
since anybody's had sex over there.

415
00:39:39,463 --> 00:39:41,590
Oh, maybe your table's ready.

416
00:39:43,367 --> 00:39:46,632
That's-- That's a long story.

417
00:39:47,638 --> 00:39:49,469
Well, I'll have to hear about it
another time.

418
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:51,674
I'm gonna take off,
but it's a small village...

419
00:39:51,875 --> 00:39:53,866
-...I'm sure we'll meet again.
-I'm sure we will.

420
00:39:54,077 --> 00:39:55,840
All right. Good night.

421
00:39:56,313 --> 00:39:57,439
Good night, Beth.

422
00:39:59,049 --> 00:40:00,812
Did I tell you my name?

423
00:40:01,118 --> 00:40:03,279
No, no. I heard your friend use it.

424
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:07,315
But I forgot to tell you mine. I'm Stuart.

425
00:40:07,591 --> 00:40:09,559
Good to meet you, Stuart.

426
00:40:10,093 --> 00:40:11,617
Good night.

427
00:40:22,739 --> 00:40:24,331
Lorna!

428
00:40:27,377 --> 00:40:28,867
Lorna!

429
00:40:35,719 --> 00:40:37,050
Lorna.

430
00:40:38,555 --> 00:40:40,546
Excuse me.

431
00:40:45,862 --> 00:40:47,124
Lorna!

432
00:40:49,533 --> 00:40:50,693
Lorna!

433
00:40:51,702 --> 00:40:53,863
Beth, I'm sorry!

434
00:40:54,938 --> 00:40:56,803
You promised.

435
00:40:57,407 --> 00:40:59,204
I know.

436
00:40:59,409 --> 00:41:01,400
I'm sorry!

437
00:41:40,183 --> 00:41:42,549
It's so peaceful.

438
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:45,786
It's so secluded.

439
00:41:50,327 --> 00:41:52,921
Roman, what are you doing?

440
00:42:03,306 --> 00:42:04,273
Come to me.

441
00:42:13,083 --> 00:42:15,051
Close your eyes.

442
00:42:17,421 --> 00:42:19,412
Roman! Roman!

443
00:42:21,258 --> 00:42:24,250
Roman! Roman!

444
00:42:24,461 --> 00:42:26,793
Roman! Roman!

445
00:42:46,616 --> 00:42:48,743
--on a boat
and I have no idea where she is.

446
00:42:48,952 --> 00:42:52,319
-How does she get back from that?
-Beth, come on!

447
00:42:53,523 --> 00:42:55,388
Oh, fuck!

448
00:42:56,927 --> 00:42:58,656
Beth!

449
00:42:59,362 --> 00:43:01,694
I cannot leave her alone with this guy.

450
00:43:01,898 --> 00:43:05,334
You know, you just go ahead
and I'll wait for Lorna.

451
00:43:05,535 --> 00:43:07,503
-You go. Yeah.
-Yeah?

452
00:43:07,704 --> 00:43:09,569
-All right. Thank you so much.
-Okay.

453
00:43:09,773 --> 00:43:11,263
-Sure. Yeah.
-Thank you.

454
00:43:11,608 --> 00:43:12,905
Fuck!

455
00:43:13,109 --> 00:43:15,873
-Dude, are you coming?
-Are you okay?

456
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:17,774
I'm good. I'm good. No, I'm fine.

457
00:43:17,981 --> 00:43:19,812
-Are you all right?
-Dude, I'm fine.

458
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:22,175
Have another cocktail.

459
00:43:26,656 --> 00:43:28,521
All right, good night.

460
00:43:29,226 --> 00:43:31,387
No, Whit. We're going to sleep.

461
00:43:31,595 --> 00:43:32,857
-We are?
-Yeah.

462
00:43:33,063 --> 00:43:36,191
Okay, is he hot,
or is he too, like, eastern bloc?

463
00:43:36,399 --> 00:43:39,596
He's fine. But can we please go
get some rest? Come on.

464
00:43:39,803 --> 00:43:41,600
Oh, you're so sweet. No, I'm fine.

465
00:43:41,805 --> 00:43:43,773
It's okay. I'll take care of her.

466
00:43:44,174 --> 00:43:47,769
I'm sure you will, but not tonight,
all right? Good night, Miroslav.

467
00:43:47,978 --> 00:43:50,003
Good night, Miroslav!

468
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:00,356
I'm sorry. He was just so shady.

469
00:44:00,891 --> 00:44:03,416
Whatever. I wanted to fuck him, but....

470
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:07,287
I know you did. I'll make it up to you.

471
00:44:08,031 --> 00:44:11,592
I guess Mr. Rabbit's gonna have to
go down the hole again tonight.

472
00:44:14,504 --> 00:44:16,028
Do you have a AA?

473
00:44:16,473 --> 00:44:18,202
Mr. Rabbit!

474
00:44:18,708 --> 00:44:20,699
Come here, Rabbit!

475
00:44:26,383 --> 00:44:29,011
Do you remember the first guy
in your high school to get laid?

476
00:44:29,219 --> 00:44:30,447
No, but I remember the last.

477
00:44:30,654 --> 00:44:32,815
Well, I do. This kid Greg.

478
00:44:33,023 --> 00:44:37,722
He came back from summer break,
something about him had changed.

479
00:44:37,928 --> 00:44:41,193
It wasn't anything he said or did, but
something was different. You knew it.

480
00:44:41,398 --> 00:44:45,357
I know what you mean. It's like you can
sense it the way an animal senses it.

481
00:44:45,569 --> 00:44:47,059
Exactly. Like an animal.

482
00:44:47,337 --> 00:44:50,795
Sometimes you meet a guy and there's
something fucking scary about him...

483
00:44:51,007 --> 00:44:53,805
...something that makes you think,
"This guy has killed somebody."

484
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:57,138
He doesn't have to act tough.
He never has to say it.

485
00:44:57,347 --> 00:44:59,975
But like an animal, you can sense it.

486
00:45:00,450 --> 00:45:04,409
You know that this guy's got the balls
to do what few others can.

487
00:45:05,188 --> 00:45:07,213
And that's you after today, my friend.

488
00:45:07,424 --> 00:45:10,484
People are gonna fucking fear you.
Linda is gonna fucking fear you.

489
00:45:10,694 --> 00:45:15,495
What we do today is gonna pay off
every day for the rest of our lives.

490
00:45:16,099 --> 00:45:19,227
-Where's your pager?
-It's back in the room.

491
00:45:19,436 --> 00:45:21,700
-Come on. What the fuck?
-I just figured you had yours.

492
00:45:21,905 --> 00:45:24,703
Is it me? Because it feels like
you're, like, having second thoughts.

493
00:45:24,908 --> 00:45:27,843
You've never really been into this.
I feel like I'm talking you into it.

494
00:45:28,044 --> 00:45:30,604
I don't wanna be doing something
and keep talking about it--

495
00:45:30,814 --> 00:45:35,342
-It's different from taking on an image.
-I am so fucking tired of talking about it.

496
00:45:35,552 --> 00:45:37,850
It's time we fucking do it.

497
00:45:47,297 --> 00:45:48,764
To the next level.

498
00:45:48,965 --> 00:45:51,024
To the next level. No, wait.

499
00:45:51,234 --> 00:45:53,065
Isn't it bad luck to toast with water?

500
00:45:53,269 --> 00:45:57,137
Yeah. Bad luck
for whoever meets us today.

501
00:46:01,845 --> 00:46:04,336
Yeah. Let the games begin.

502
00:46:24,868 --> 00:46:26,426
Hard, hard, hard.

503
00:46:26,636 --> 00:46:28,297
Hey.

504
00:46:28,805 --> 00:46:32,241
-Hey, did she call?
-No. I just checked.

505
00:46:32,809 --> 00:46:35,676
I love that Lorna's the only one of us
that got any action last night.

506
00:46:35,879 --> 00:46:39,246
-Hey, I tried.
-Keep trying.

507
00:46:40,050 --> 00:46:42,575
Yeah, she'd say
this place is majestic.

508
00:46:42,786 --> 00:46:43,753
Sure.

509
00:46:43,953 --> 00:46:45,784
I bet she's making him
breakfast right now.

510
00:46:45,989 --> 00:46:47,513
No, I bet she's in a cum coma.

511
00:46:48,291 --> 00:46:49,986
Thank God.

512
00:46:51,294 --> 00:46:53,592
At least she has something
to write about in her journal.

513
00:50:59,475 --> 00:51:00,965
Please! Please!

514
00:51:01,177 --> 00:51:02,974
Please! Stop!

515
00:51:03,246 --> 00:51:04,372
No!

516
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:07,174
Stop! Please! Please!

517
00:51:14,023 --> 00:51:15,547
Please! Please!

518
00:51:15,758 --> 00:51:18,454
Please, no!

519
00:52:46,482 --> 00:52:48,109
Relax.

520
00:52:52,321 --> 00:52:53,913
Come up here.

521
00:54:26,782 --> 00:54:28,340
Whit?

522
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:38,957
Axelle?

523
00:54:59,882 --> 00:55:01,440
Fuck.

524
00:55:04,787 --> 00:55:06,311
Whit!

525
00:55:08,224 --> 00:55:10,021
Guys!

526
00:55:14,096 --> 00:55:16,621
Axelle! Whit!

527
00:56:00,710 --> 00:56:02,143
Stop. Please help me!

528
00:56:02,345 --> 00:56:03,835
-Go away.
-Please help me!

529
00:56:04,046 --> 00:56:05,479
-Just go away from me!
-No, no, no.

530
00:56:05,915 --> 00:56:07,849
Help me.
These men are chasing me. Please.

531
00:56:08,050 --> 00:56:11,850
I tried to help, but you don't listen.
Go away!

532
00:56:41,884 --> 00:56:43,647
Dollar, bitch!

533
00:56:51,961 --> 00:56:53,656
Stop!

534
00:57:25,795 --> 00:57:27,353
Get in.

535
00:57:27,596 --> 00:57:29,063
Yeah.

536
01:00:02,551 --> 01:00:05,111
The police will be here soon.

537
01:00:05,754 --> 01:00:07,813
They are looking for your friends.

538
01:00:08,557 --> 01:00:10,184
Thank-- Thank you.

539
01:00:10,793 --> 01:00:12,317
More tea?

540
01:00:12,728 --> 01:00:14,195
Please.

541
01:00:19,902 --> 01:00:21,335
Thank you.

542
01:00:36,485 --> 01:00:38,248
So, you and Sasha...

543
01:00:38,721 --> 01:00:42,122
-...are you two...?
-Oh, no. God, no.

544
01:00:42,324 --> 01:00:44,053
He's old enough to be my dad.

545
01:00:46,328 --> 01:00:47,955
What does he do?

546
01:00:48,163 --> 01:00:49,994
He does auctions.

547
01:00:50,466 --> 01:00:52,866
Come. Let's get you some clothes.

548
01:01:21,931 --> 01:01:23,728
No!

549
01:01:23,933 --> 01:01:25,491
No!

550
01:01:27,536 --> 01:01:30,699
Help! No! No!

551
01:01:49,592 --> 01:01:51,685
What did I do wrong?

552
01:01:54,563 --> 01:01:58,021
Please don't hurt me.
Please don't hurt me. I'm sorry.

553
01:01:58,834 --> 01:02:00,631
Please don't hurt me.
Please don't hurt me.

554
01:02:00,836 --> 01:02:03,031
I not hurt you.

555
01:02:03,372 --> 01:02:05,738
Okay. It's okay.

556
01:02:05,941 --> 01:02:07,101
I clean you up.

557
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:10,444
Please, please help me.

558
01:02:11,313 --> 01:02:13,304
You have a bruise.

559
01:02:16,385 --> 01:02:17,909
What is that?

560
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:19,781
What are you doing?

561
01:02:21,523 --> 01:02:23,457
I make you pretty.

562
01:02:24,827 --> 01:02:26,260
Pretty for what?

563
01:02:27,196 --> 01:02:28,891
For the client.

564
01:02:29,231 --> 01:02:31,358
Client? What client?

565
01:02:59,294 --> 01:03:00,625
Give me. No.

566
01:03:00,863 --> 01:03:01,830
No.

567
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,058
We do...

568
01:03:06,935 --> 01:03:08,869
...nails.

569
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:32,418
No!

570
01:03:42,538 --> 01:03:44,597
No! No!

571
01:03:50,879 --> 01:03:52,710
Oh, my God.

572
01:03:54,316 --> 01:03:55,715
No!

573
01:04:05,694 --> 01:04:07,423
I'm worried about Whit.

574
01:04:09,798 --> 01:04:11,925
Whitney seems like a tough girl.

575
01:04:12,134 --> 01:04:14,102
She'll be okay.

576
01:04:17,606 --> 01:04:19,733
You have a scratch.

577
01:04:21,744 --> 01:04:23,109
Yeah.

578
01:04:32,755 --> 01:04:35,781
-It's sore.
-I'm sorry.

579
01:04:36,792 --> 01:04:39,693
You have such beautiful skin.

580
01:04:39,895 --> 01:04:41,419
Thank you.

581
01:04:45,100 --> 01:04:46,260
Who's that?

582
01:04:47,302 --> 01:04:49,270
Just some friends.

583
01:04:49,938 --> 01:04:51,735
Come. You should lie down.

584
01:04:51,940 --> 01:04:53,908
I'll wake you up when the police arrive.

585
01:06:54,429 --> 01:06:56,226
Do you think we're sick?

586
01:06:57,766 --> 01:06:58,926
Fuck, no.

587
01:06:59,668 --> 01:07:02,398
Dude, you look anywhere in the world
where there's no law...

588
01:07:03,071 --> 01:07:05,801
...whether it's fucking Chad
or New Orleans...

589
01:07:06,008 --> 01:07:08,033
...and this is the shit
people are doing, bro.

590
01:07:10,245 --> 01:07:12,179
We're the normal ones.

591
01:07:18,453 --> 01:07:20,114
Any idea what
you're gonna do in there?

592
01:07:23,425 --> 01:07:25,484
You don't even wanna know.

593
01:07:27,195 --> 01:07:29,356
You don't even wanna know.

594
01:10:58,907 --> 01:11:00,465
Jesus.

595
01:12:10,812 --> 01:12:12,507
They're listening. They're listening.

596
01:12:14,015 --> 01:12:18,076
Beth, it's me. It's Stuart.
From the fair.

597
01:12:18,420 --> 01:12:21,355
Don't talk loud. Okay?

598
01:12:21,556 --> 01:12:24,320
If they hear us talking like this...

599
01:12:24,659 --> 01:12:26,354
...they're gonna fucking kill us both.

600
01:12:27,162 --> 01:12:28,254
You hear me?

601
01:12:28,797 --> 01:12:30,594
I need to know you're listening.

602
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:33,792
Okay?

603
01:12:48,450 --> 01:12:50,748
What the fuck are you doing?

604
01:12:51,186 --> 01:12:54,485
What is this place?
Where the fuck are we?

605
01:12:55,523 --> 01:12:57,218
Stuart!

606
01:12:58,927 --> 01:13:02,693
Remember when I said that
I didn't know what I was doing here?

607
01:13:04,633 --> 01:13:06,157
Well...

608
01:13:08,036 --> 01:13:10,197
...this is what I'm doing here.

609
01:13:13,241 --> 01:13:14,708
What is this place?

610
01:13:16,945 --> 01:13:18,708
This place....

611
01:13:20,048 --> 01:13:21,845
People come here....

612
01:13:23,618 --> 01:13:25,313
People come here to kill people.

613
01:13:26,921 --> 01:13:30,220
What? Who kills?

614
01:13:31,159 --> 01:13:33,127
Oh, my God, are they gonna kill us?

615
01:13:33,695 --> 01:13:34,889
Well...

616
01:13:36,364 --> 01:13:37,831
...not...

617
01:13:38,033 --> 01:13:39,261
...us.

618
01:13:40,568 --> 01:13:42,502
Oh, my God.

619
01:13:42,971 --> 01:13:45,166
Oh, my God. Are you gonna kill me?

620
01:13:45,373 --> 01:13:48,536
-You're gonna kill me!
-No. No, no! No, no, no.

621
01:13:48,743 --> 01:13:51,837
No. Jesus, no. No.

622
01:13:52,147 --> 01:13:54,445
Then what the fuck
are you doing here?

623
01:13:54,649 --> 01:13:56,207
What the fuck are you wearing?

624
01:13:56,418 --> 01:13:58,409
Someone brought me here...

625
01:13:58,620 --> 01:14:00,349
...the same as you.

626
01:14:01,289 --> 01:14:02,984
Someone I know.

627
01:14:04,326 --> 01:14:05,759
Look...

628
01:14:05,994 --> 01:14:07,723
...he wanted me to--

629
01:14:07,929 --> 01:14:10,591
To do this with him.

630
01:14:11,199 --> 01:14:12,757
What?

631
01:14:13,201 --> 01:14:14,395
Stuart, please.

632
01:14:15,103 --> 01:14:17,264
Please just let me go.
Help me get out of this chair.

633
01:14:17,472 --> 01:14:21,602
Please. Please help me get out of this
chair. Get me out of this chair, please!

634
01:14:44,165 --> 01:14:47,566
You probably used that face to get
whatever the fuck you wanted.

635
01:14:48,069 --> 01:14:50,037
Fucking skank.

636
01:15:03,518 --> 01:15:05,884
Oh, that's fucking rich.

637
01:15:06,688 --> 01:15:09,020
You should see your fucking face.

638
01:15:12,961 --> 01:15:16,226
-We gotta get out of here.
-We can't.

639
01:15:16,965 --> 01:15:19,263
They think you're gonna kill me?

640
01:15:19,768 --> 01:15:21,963
You're not some monster.

641
01:15:23,705 --> 01:15:26,003
-I'm not that guy.
-No.

642
01:15:26,207 --> 01:15:27,435
No, I know.

643
01:15:27,642 --> 01:15:30,202
-I know you're a good person.
-I'm not that guy.

644
01:15:30,945 --> 01:15:33,038
I know. Of course not.

645
01:15:33,248 --> 01:15:35,011
I'm not that guy.

646
01:15:38,319 --> 01:15:41,618
-Okay. Okay.
-I'm not that guy.

647
01:15:44,526 --> 01:15:46,460
We're gonna get out of here.

648
01:15:53,334 --> 01:15:55,234
I'm not that guy.

649
01:15:59,841 --> 01:16:01,866
I'm not that guy.

650
01:16:04,879 --> 01:16:06,904
I'm not that guy.

651
01:16:08,016 --> 01:16:09,779
There must be a co--

652
01:16:32,607 --> 01:16:34,734
Oh, fuck. Fuck.

653
01:16:50,792 --> 01:16:53,454
Christ! Fuck!

654
01:16:54,262 --> 01:16:55,627
God!

655
01:16:57,732 --> 01:16:58,790
Fuck!

656
01:17:00,068 --> 01:17:03,367
Don't you have family?
Don't you have a wife?

657
01:17:04,239 --> 01:17:05,706
My wife?

658
01:17:05,907 --> 01:17:07,602
My wife?

659
01:17:09,844 --> 01:17:11,675
I'm not allowed to kill my wife.

660
01:17:32,133 --> 01:17:34,226
-Finish?
-Yeah, I'm finished, all right.

661
01:17:34,435 --> 01:17:37,302
Hey, hey! You cannot done.

662
01:17:37,505 --> 01:17:39,200
You go in room, finish.

663
01:17:39,941 --> 01:17:41,408
You know what? I am fucking done.

664
01:17:41,609 --> 01:17:44,077
If you don't like it, you can go in
and finish her yourself.

665
01:17:44,279 --> 01:17:46,873
You cannot leave unless
you complete. It's contract.

666
01:17:47,081 --> 01:17:48,708
I fucking paid!

667
01:17:48,917 --> 01:17:50,714
You have my money
and you can keep it!

668
01:17:50,919 --> 01:17:54,286
I am not going back in that room!
I'm done!

669
01:17:54,489 --> 01:17:56,354
Hey! Hey!

670
01:18:55,116 --> 01:18:57,482
Hello. Special offer.

671
01:18:57,685 --> 01:19:01,086
But she's only available
for the next 20 minutes.

672
01:19:01,322 --> 01:19:02,914
Do you want her?

673
01:19:07,795 --> 01:19:09,422
We'll let you know.

674
01:19:50,004 --> 01:19:51,631
Six-fifty.

675
01:20:10,758 --> 01:20:11,725
Yes?

676
01:20:12,260 --> 01:20:17,095
Apologies for interrupting you, but
we have special available right now.

677
01:20:17,298 --> 01:20:18,629
Very good price.

678
01:20:24,505 --> 01:20:26,302
Where's Todd?

679
01:20:38,619 --> 01:20:40,348
Problem with friend.

680
01:20:43,758 --> 01:20:46,056
May I borrow this
for a moment, please?

681
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:53,924
What do you think?

682
01:20:54,135 --> 01:20:55,830
Should I do it?

683
01:20:56,037 --> 01:20:58,267
I mean, I wouldn't pay
more than a grand for her...

684
01:20:58,473 --> 01:21:00,270
...in this kind of shape, but....

685
01:21:00,475 --> 01:21:02,340
I mean, look at that.

686
01:21:02,543 --> 01:21:04,408
She's not gonna last that long, huh?

687
01:21:06,380 --> 01:21:08,780
You should see
what she did to my friend.

688
01:21:14,122 --> 01:21:15,521
I'll take her.

689
01:21:56,531 --> 01:21:58,795
A souvenir from your friend.

690
01:22:08,943 --> 01:22:11,002
Notice anything different about me?

691
01:22:13,748 --> 01:22:15,807
I bet you fucking do.

692
01:22:16,884 --> 01:22:18,681
Fucking bitch.

693
01:22:23,457 --> 01:22:25,584
Fucking respect me now.

694
01:22:27,461 --> 01:22:29,861
I don't fucking work for you!

695
01:22:31,032 --> 01:22:34,160
I don't work all fucking day
for you to humiliate me.

696
01:22:37,872 --> 01:22:39,032
To tell me I'm shit.

697
01:22:43,377 --> 01:22:44,810
Never fuck me.

698
01:22:46,214 --> 01:22:47,772
Look at you.

699
01:22:48,316 --> 01:22:49,613
What?

700
01:22:49,817 --> 01:22:52,809
What, you got something to say?
Do you? You do, bitch?

701
01:22:53,020 --> 01:22:56,421
Yeah? Oh, good.
Well, it better be fucking good.

702
01:22:56,858 --> 01:23:00,350
-Let's fucking hear it. What?
-I'm not your wife.

703
01:23:00,561 --> 01:23:04,327
I'm not your wife, Stuart.
I'm not your wife.

704
01:23:05,366 --> 01:23:10,030
She doesn't understand you.
She doesn't understand you like I do.

705
01:23:10,238 --> 01:23:13,401
-And I see how you're strong.
-I am strong.

706
01:23:13,608 --> 01:23:16,338
-I am fucking Hercules!
-I see.

707
01:23:17,278 --> 01:23:19,838
I know. I know. I see it. I see it.

708
01:23:20,214 --> 01:23:21,613
I saw it last night.

709
01:23:21,816 --> 01:23:25,377
I was hoping you would kiss me.
I wanted you to kiss me.

710
01:23:27,154 --> 01:23:29,520
I thought about you all night.

711
01:23:36,564 --> 01:23:38,725
Get on the fucking floor.

712
01:23:48,709 --> 01:23:50,108
Are you scared?

713
01:23:53,080 --> 01:23:55,071
You fucking better be.

714
01:23:56,784 --> 01:23:58,342
I am.

715
01:23:59,253 --> 01:24:01,050
I like it.

716
01:24:15,169 --> 01:24:16,727
Look at me.

717
01:24:19,006 --> 01:24:20,371
Bitch.

718
01:24:21,742 --> 01:24:24,472
You fucking whore.

719
01:24:49,470 --> 01:24:51,301
Get in the chair!

720
01:24:51,505 --> 01:24:53,302
Get in the fucking chair!

721
01:24:57,511 --> 01:24:58,978
Fucker!

722
01:25:16,364 --> 01:25:17,331
What's the code?

723
01:25:17,665 --> 01:25:19,496
Fuck you!

724
01:25:23,604 --> 01:25:25,162
What's the fucking code?

725
01:25:28,809 --> 01:25:30,572
-Your birthday.
-What?

726
01:25:30,778 --> 01:25:32,575
What is your birthday?

727
01:25:32,780 --> 01:25:34,714
December 1 2th.

728
01:25:36,384 --> 01:25:39,012
Oh, that is fucking sick.

729
01:25:55,803 --> 01:25:57,236
What the fuck? It's not opening.

730
01:25:59,040 --> 01:26:01,736
It's not fucking opening!

731
01:26:01,942 --> 01:26:03,807
Oh, yes, it is.

732
01:26:05,079 --> 01:26:08,105
Do it! She's right up there
behind you! Kill her!

733
01:26:08,315 --> 01:26:11,113
Motherfucker! Shoot her!

734
01:26:11,452 --> 01:26:13,852
Kill her! Kill her!

735
01:26:17,124 --> 01:26:18,853
Don't shoot!
Be careful, for God's sakes!

736
01:26:19,060 --> 01:26:21,051
She'll cut! She'll fucking cut!
Don't shoot!

737
01:26:21,262 --> 01:26:22,593
Fucking she'll cut! She'll cut!

738
01:26:23,831 --> 01:26:25,162
Get Sasha!

739
01:26:25,399 --> 01:26:29,267
You gotta do it! I'm the fucking
customer here! Do it, for fuck's sake.

740
01:26:29,470 --> 01:26:31,301
Jesus fucking Christ. Oh, shit!

741
01:26:31,505 --> 01:26:32,563
-Sasha!
-Get him!

742
01:26:50,424 --> 01:26:52,324
-Wait! I wanna buy my way out of here.
-Wait!

743
01:26:55,696 --> 01:26:58,688
-You can't afford it.
-Don't tell me what I can't afford.

744
01:26:58,899 --> 01:27:03,063
There's nothing I can't afford. I could
buy and sell everyone in this room.

745
01:27:04,205 --> 01:27:06,400
You going to call your parents
for money?

746
01:27:06,607 --> 01:27:08,700
No, motherfucker, it's my money.

747
01:27:08,909 --> 01:27:11,901
Just get me a PDA, a SWlFT number
and a recipient name.

748
01:27:12,113 --> 01:27:14,980
I have accounts in Switzerland,
Luxembourg and the lsle of Man.

749
01:27:15,182 --> 01:27:19,243
Just name your fucking price!
Trust me, I got it.

750
01:27:21,122 --> 01:27:22,646
Okay.

751
01:27:28,195 --> 01:27:29,321
We negotiate.

752
01:27:30,598 --> 01:27:33,431
-This is bullshit!
-This is business.

753
01:27:33,734 --> 01:27:34,792
I'll pay more!

754
01:27:35,236 --> 01:27:37,204
Not with a second mortgage
on your house...

755
01:27:37,404 --> 01:27:39,463
...and your daughter's
private-school tuition.

756
01:27:39,940 --> 01:27:41,635
That's why your friend pay.

757
01:27:41,842 --> 01:27:43,707
What's the number?

758
01:27:44,845 --> 01:27:47,245
Money is not the only issue.

759
01:27:47,448 --> 01:27:49,075
We have contract here.

760
01:27:49,884 --> 01:27:51,317
What kind of contract?

761
01:27:52,786 --> 01:27:55,414
Anyone who come to this place...

762
01:27:55,623 --> 01:27:57,250
...cannot leave...

763
01:27:57,458 --> 01:27:59,016
...without killing.

764
01:27:59,960 --> 01:28:03,487
They're still gonna kill you,
you fucking stupid cunt.

765
01:28:04,899 --> 01:28:06,628
What did you say to me?

766
01:28:08,569 --> 01:28:11,367
You're a stupid fucking cu--!

767
01:28:28,255 --> 01:28:29,620
Let him bleed to death.

768
01:28:31,392 --> 01:28:32,416
Misha, no!

769
01:29:13,033 --> 01:29:14,967
Isn't this great?

770
01:29:21,308 --> 01:29:23,572
Hey, get back here!

771
01:29:25,746 --> 01:29:26,940
Wait!

772
01:29:27,147 --> 01:29:29,047
Wait! Wait!

773
01:29:30,818 --> 01:29:31,910
Wait!

774
01:29:33,053 --> 01:29:34,020
Hey!

775
01:29:34,455 --> 01:29:37,049
You fucking shit! Wait!

776
01:34:39,126 --> 01:34:41,026
Bitches!
