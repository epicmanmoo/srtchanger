1
00:03:20,594 --> 00:03:23,620
He say, "Good morning,"
and ask, "How is your hand?"

2
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:27,288
It's-- It's better.

3
00:03:27,534 --> 00:03:28,728
What's left of it.

4
00:03:31,772 --> 00:03:33,205
Sorry.

5
00:03:33,473 --> 00:03:36,237
We would like to speak with you
if you feel well enough.

6
00:03:36,443 --> 00:03:38,570
Yeah, that's all right.

7
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,174
-Coffee?
-No, thank you.

8
00:03:46,086 --> 00:03:49,453
Tell us about this place you mention,
in Slovakia.

9
00:03:50,757 --> 00:03:52,588
It's this....

10
00:03:53,493 --> 00:03:55,358
It's some kind of factory...

11
00:03:55,929 --> 00:03:58,397
,,,where these people,
these very rich people,,,

12
00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:01,659
,,,they pay to torture and kill kids,

13
00:04:02,202 --> 00:04:03,897
Mostly backpackers,

14
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,972
And they killed two of my friends.

15
00:04:24,992 --> 00:04:26,584
They take you from this hostel...

16
00:04:27,661 --> 00:04:30,289
,,,and they bring you
to this factory and,,,,

17
00:04:31,898 --> 00:04:34,662
I went there looking for Josh,

18
00:04:34,868 --> 00:04:39,305
He was one of my friends
and they took him there and....

19
00:04:42,042 --> 00:04:43,873
And they,,,,

20
00:04:44,077 --> 00:04:45,044
They killed him,

21
00:04:48,715 --> 00:04:50,410
It was horrible.

22
00:05:02,195 --> 00:05:03,924
He ask how you survive.

23
00:05:08,435 --> 00:05:09,402
I....

24
00:05:18,445 --> 00:05:20,345
I escaped.

25
00:05:31,258 --> 00:05:33,351
Who organize this place?

26
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:38,930
I don't know.
It's some kind of hunting club. They....

27
00:05:39,466 --> 00:05:42,526
They all have the same tattoo.

28
00:05:42,736 --> 00:05:43,828
It's a dog,

29
00:05:44,037 --> 00:05:45,561
It's a bloodhound dog,

30
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,845
Strange that you mention this tattoo.

31
00:06:04,191 --> 00:06:05,249
Why?

32
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:18,803
Because someone was found dead
in a train station bathroom in Vienna...

33
00:06:19,005 --> 00:06:21,405
...with this same bloodhound tattoo
you describe.

34
00:06:28,782 --> 00:06:32,912
Security tapes from this station
show him entering from a platform...

35
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,250
...where a train arrive earlier that day
from Slovakia.

36
00:06:37,457 --> 00:06:39,948
It came through
the same station in Vienna.

37
00:06:44,464 --> 00:06:46,432
You were on that tape.

38
00:06:52,272 --> 00:06:56,072
Did his tattoo look something like this?

39
00:06:56,576 --> 00:06:58,203
What the fuck's going on?

40
00:06:58,412 --> 00:07:00,607
Help! Somebody help me!

41
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,486
Jesus.

42
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:27,597
You hungry?

43
00:07:28,074 --> 00:07:30,099
It's 3:1 5 in the morning.

44
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:33,006
I have to take these with food.
I wanna know if you want anything.

45
00:07:33,246 --> 00:07:36,147
Yeah, I want you to talk to someone.

46
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:39,243
When are you gonna tell
Josh's mother what happened?

47
00:07:39,453 --> 00:07:40,750
I'm not.

48
00:07:43,089 --> 00:07:44,920
She still thinks her son's in Europe.

49
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:47,389
What the fuck
am I supposed to tell her?

50
00:07:47,594 --> 00:07:50,620
-She'll go straight to the police.
-Yeah, exactly. Someone should.

51
00:07:50,831 --> 00:07:54,961
No, no one should. You don't get it.
These people are tied into everyone.

52
00:07:55,168 --> 00:07:56,601
Somebody starts asking questions...

53
00:07:56,803 --> 00:07:58,668
...they're gonna come after me
and find me.

54
00:07:59,072 --> 00:08:02,906
At my grandmother's house? I've
been coming here since I was a kid.

55
00:08:03,109 --> 00:08:05,907
I can barely find the place.
I had to ask my sister for directions.

56
00:08:06,112 --> 00:08:08,137
-You told your sister we were here?
-Yeah. So?

57
00:08:08,348 --> 00:08:10,839
-Well, who else knows?
-No one!

58
00:08:11,051 --> 00:08:12,518
Jesus.

59
00:08:13,653 --> 00:08:16,144
I'm doing this for your protection too.
You know that, right?

60
00:08:16,356 --> 00:08:18,688
Oh, Paxton....

61
00:08:21,027 --> 00:08:22,016
Look.

62
00:08:22,629 --> 00:08:25,029
I took you back because I felt bad.

63
00:08:25,565 --> 00:08:27,965
But you're going crazy.

64
00:08:28,168 --> 00:08:31,626
You wake up every night screaming,
and I can't sleep.

65
00:08:31,838 --> 00:08:33,430
Well, that won't
be a problem anymore.

66
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,267
Paxton, that's not what l--

67
00:08:36,243 --> 00:08:38,609
Oh, fuck.

68
00:09:08,942 --> 00:09:10,603
Morning!

69
00:09:29,629 --> 00:09:31,460
Paxton?

70
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,868
Hey.

71
00:11:01,154 --> 00:11:02,621
Lorna?

72
00:11:02,922 --> 00:11:04,480
Lorna?

73
00:11:06,793 --> 00:11:10,194
Sorry. I was trying to be
in the moment.

74
00:11:10,397 --> 00:11:12,365
Absorb.

75
00:11:17,737 --> 00:11:20,831
Do you think she ever saw a cock
before this class?

76
00:11:21,141 --> 00:11:23,336
If she did, it was in a Botticelli.

77
00:11:23,543 --> 00:11:24,805
Oh, my God.

78
00:11:25,011 --> 00:11:28,879
If I hear her talk about how emotional
the Botticelllis are one more time...

79
00:11:29,082 --> 00:11:31,846
...I swear to God,
I'm gonna choke the bitch to death.

80
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,091
Until Tuesday.

81
00:11:42,295 --> 00:11:43,694
Are you all packed for Prague?

82
00:11:43,897 --> 00:11:46,297
-Jeans. No heels.
-Awesome.

83
00:11:46,499 --> 00:11:48,990
I can't do it on the cobblestone.
I don't know how you do it.

84
00:11:49,202 --> 00:11:51,295
I can teach you if you bring heels.

85
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:58,175
Axelle.

86
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:10,051
Hands on your pencils, boys.

87
00:12:24,738 --> 00:12:27,070
-Would he ever?
-Excuse me, girls.

88
00:12:27,273 --> 00:12:28,570
-Excuse me. Hi.
-Hi.

89
00:12:28,775 --> 00:12:31,471
-May I see?
-Oh, they're just rough.

90
00:12:31,678 --> 00:12:34,203
Show her. Don't be shy.

91
00:12:37,817 --> 00:12:39,114
That's the one of you.

92
00:12:39,352 --> 00:12:42,719
-Oh, wow, that's beautiful.
-Thanks.

93
00:12:42,922 --> 00:12:44,412
How much would you want for it?

94
00:12:44,624 --> 00:12:46,558
I wouldn't sell them.
You can have this one.

95
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,250
-Really?
-Yeah.

96
00:12:48,461 --> 00:12:51,726
-Oh, my God, thank you so much.
-You're welcome.

97
00:12:51,931 --> 00:12:54,126
Can I buy you a drink or something?

98
00:12:54,334 --> 00:12:57,770
Oh, I'm actually late. We're
catching a train to Prague, but....

99
00:12:57,971 --> 00:13:00,303
-I don't know. Maybe some other time.
-Okay.

100
00:13:00,507 --> 00:13:02,338
-Yeah! Okay.
-Okay.

101
00:13:02,542 --> 00:13:05,943
-I'll see you.
-All right. Bye. Thanks.

102
00:13:14,287 --> 00:13:16,619
No, Dad. It's Prague.
We're gonna be fine.

103
00:13:16,823 --> 00:13:18,688
It's not the Ukraine.

104
00:13:21,127 --> 00:13:22,594
No.

105
00:13:24,564 --> 00:13:26,896
No, Dad,
do not book the Four Seasons.

106
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,533
Book it, bitch. Book it. Please!

107
00:13:28,735 --> 00:13:32,694
Because, Dad, no college students
are staying at the Four Seasons.

108
00:13:32,906 --> 00:13:37,502
And, you know, it's for old people.
So thank you, but please don't.

109
00:13:38,278 --> 00:13:39,643
What?

110
00:13:42,782 --> 00:13:45,182
Yeah. Yes, we have chaperones.

111
00:13:45,385 --> 00:13:47,216
Okay, love you. Bye.

112
00:13:47,687 --> 00:13:50,349
Jesus, I hate that he calls
every fucking five minutes.

113
00:13:50,557 --> 00:13:53,720
-All right, let's go.
-Hold on. We gotta wait for someone.

114
00:13:54,327 --> 00:13:55,658
Who?

115
00:13:58,765 --> 00:13:59,789
-Yeah.
-No.

116
00:13:59,999 --> 00:14:01,057
-Yeah.
-No.

117
00:14:01,267 --> 00:14:03,895
She cornered me in the apartment.
She's homesick, crying.

118
00:14:04,103 --> 00:14:05,730
I felt bad. What am I supposed to say?

119
00:14:05,939 --> 00:14:09,136
She's homesick for Baltimore?
We're in Rome, for fuck's sake.

120
00:14:09,342 --> 00:14:10,969
She's not that bad.

121
00:14:27,093 --> 00:14:29,186
Wow, is that a new journal
you got there?

122
00:14:30,063 --> 00:14:32,190
Yeah. It's a travel journal.

123
00:14:32,398 --> 00:14:33,922
For emotional callbacks.

124
00:14:34,901 --> 00:14:36,095
Of course.

125
00:14:37,604 --> 00:14:39,538
Lorna, we're gonna grab a drink.
You wanna go?

126
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:41,705
I'm okay. Thank you.

127
00:14:42,609 --> 00:14:45,874
All right.
Well, we'll see you in a little bit. Okay.

128
00:14:47,447 --> 00:14:48,607
Knock yourself out, buddy.

129
00:14:48,882 --> 00:14:50,406
See you later.

130
00:15:02,328 --> 00:15:05,229
Excuse you. Asshole.

131
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:18,571
She's like a 20-year-old grandmother.

132
00:15:18,778 --> 00:15:20,871
Whatever. She'll watch our stuff.
She's happy there.

133
00:15:21,247 --> 00:15:23,374
That's what she likes to do.

134
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:24,982
Oh, we didn't order these.

135
00:15:25,184 --> 00:15:26,981
They're from girl.

136
00:15:30,256 --> 00:15:32,315
Whoa, your girlfriend's stalking us.

137
00:15:33,927 --> 00:15:35,622
Hey. What are you doing?

138
00:15:36,095 --> 00:15:38,256
You inspired me to take a trip.

139
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,101
Watch this.

140
00:15:52,045 --> 00:15:54,036
You've got to be kidding me.

141
00:15:54,414 --> 00:15:55,676
Hello. What's your name?

142
00:16:03,723 --> 00:16:07,352
Do you know where we could score,
like, party favors?

143
00:16:07,994 --> 00:16:09,086
What do you need?

144
00:16:09,295 --> 00:16:12,458
I don't know.
Like, bud and ecstasy and, like....

145
00:16:13,967 --> 00:16:15,298
PCP?

146
00:16:15,501 --> 00:16:17,799
Ice? Peyote? Crank?

147
00:16:18,004 --> 00:16:20,165
Okay, okay, bud and X are good.

148
00:16:22,575 --> 00:16:23,940
Sure.

149
00:16:25,011 --> 00:16:28,538
We go back to my car. I got some.

150
00:16:28,915 --> 00:16:30,143
Yeah?

151
00:16:31,484 --> 00:16:33,714
-Yeah?
-Okay.

152
00:16:43,997 --> 00:16:46,693
Fuck. You know what?

153
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:51,231
I'm trying but I can't find them.
Just hang on, yeah?

154
00:16:56,175 --> 00:16:59,008
-You want drink?
-No, I'm fine.

155
00:17:09,155 --> 00:17:10,247
Hey, you know what?

156
00:17:10,456 --> 00:17:13,584
It's okay because we can just get
it at the club when we go to Prague.

157
00:17:13,793 --> 00:17:15,727
No, stay.

158
00:17:17,463 --> 00:17:19,988
I find them. Okay?

159
00:17:25,438 --> 00:17:27,429
You smell nice.

160
00:17:29,709 --> 00:17:32,337
-Whit, we gotta go. Lorna's waiting.
-Yeah, we have our friend.

161
00:17:32,545 --> 00:17:33,876
-You have friend?
-Yeah.

162
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,413
One, two, three, perfetto, Otherwise,
we have to take turns, huh?

163
00:17:40,987 --> 00:17:42,750
You know, we're gonna go,
so never mind.

164
00:17:42,955 --> 00:17:47,255
Where you go? I knew you were
a tease, you fucking cunt.

165
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:48,757
What the fuck did you call me?

166
00:17:48,961 --> 00:17:51,759
I called you
stupid fucking American cunt!

167
00:17:51,964 --> 00:17:53,124
-Fuck you!
-You know what?

168
00:17:53,332 --> 00:17:56,824
The train to fucking Prague
is long, you bitch.

169
00:17:57,036 --> 00:17:58,731
We'll come see you.

170
00:17:59,372 --> 00:18:00,805
Are you fucking insane?

171
00:18:01,007 --> 00:18:02,372
What? I fucking hate that word.

172
00:18:02,575 --> 00:18:04,907
"Oh, you stupid American cunt."
I fucking lost my temper.

173
00:18:05,111 --> 00:18:07,375
Okay, but it's not like
we're on campus and you can...

174
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:10,174
...call the dean
and file a report or something.

175
00:18:15,188 --> 00:18:17,383
Oh, my God. Lorna, what happened?

176
00:18:17,824 --> 00:18:19,758
Some guy took my iPod.

177
00:18:19,959 --> 00:18:21,153
What?

178
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,158
Is there, like, a police officer
on the train or something?

179
00:18:24,664 --> 00:18:26,859
-Yeah. I'll go check.
-Okay.

180
00:18:28,701 --> 00:18:29,963
It had everything.

181
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:33,671
That's awful. I'm so sorry.

182
00:18:35,341 --> 00:18:37,036
I'm sorry.

183
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,638
Here you go.

184
00:18:57,029 --> 00:18:58,587
It's those fucking guys.

185
00:18:58,798 --> 00:19:01,892
The fucking guys, the ltalian guys
from the room down the hall.

186
00:19:02,635 --> 00:19:04,796
-What do we do?
-Just be quiet.

187
00:19:13,546 --> 00:19:14,570
-Hi.
-Hi.

188
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:17,112
Excuse me.
Did one of you girls lose this?

189
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:19,315
Oh, my God!

190
00:19:19,986 --> 00:19:21,749
How did you know this was mine?

191
00:19:21,954 --> 00:19:25,151
I saw some guy run out of your room.
He tried to take my bag.

192
00:19:25,558 --> 00:19:27,958
I fought him off
and this felled out of his pocket.

193
00:19:28,494 --> 00:19:30,894
I'm a little worried he might
come back looking for me.

194
00:19:31,097 --> 00:19:33,565
Well, do you wanna come in here
and hang out with us?

195
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:35,630
-Really?
-Yeah, we have an extra seat.

196
00:19:35,835 --> 00:19:36,961
-Yeah, come in.
-Totally.

197
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:38,330
Thank you.

198
00:19:41,307 --> 00:19:42,934
I think...

199
00:19:43,142 --> 00:19:45,007
...we all need a little of this.

200
00:19:45,978 --> 00:19:47,411
Oh, awesome.

201
00:19:48,814 --> 00:19:50,975
Oh, no, thanks. I don't drink.

202
00:19:51,517 --> 00:19:53,109
Thank you.

203
00:19:53,419 --> 00:19:55,819
As my father always says:

204
00:19:56,055 --> 00:19:58,250
"Nazdrovia." To your health.

205
00:20:11,704 --> 00:20:14,434
So are you going to Prague
for the football match?

206
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,437
I kind of wanna go home.

207
00:20:16,642 --> 00:20:21,102
Oh, I don't blame you. I got
robbed twice on the overnight train.

208
00:20:21,314 --> 00:20:23,179
There are so few safe places
left in Europe.

209
00:20:23,816 --> 00:20:25,078
So where are you going?

210
00:20:26,185 --> 00:20:27,743
On a little spa vacation.

211
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:29,254
Where?

212
00:20:29,789 --> 00:20:31,017
Slovakia.

213
00:20:31,224 --> 00:20:33,454
Wait, wasn't there, like,
some war in Slovakia?

214
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:37,791
There hasn't been war in Slovakia
for 50 years.

215
00:20:37,997 --> 00:20:39,225
That's Bosnia, darling.

216
00:20:39,432 --> 00:20:41,730
-Oh, like you knew.
-I did so.

217
00:20:41,934 --> 00:20:43,458
What are the spas like there?

218
00:20:43,669 --> 00:20:47,298
They're the best natural hot springs
in the world.

219
00:20:47,506 --> 00:20:51,567
I go twice a year. It's great to get away
from the ltalian guys.

220
00:20:51,777 --> 00:20:53,108
They get to be a bit much.

221
00:20:54,313 --> 00:20:56,304
Wow, hot springs?

222
00:20:56,515 --> 00:20:59,882
That sounds so therapeutic.
I wanna go.

223
00:21:00,086 --> 00:21:03,613
It's very easy. You just have to
switch trains in Prague.

224
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:07,020
It could be nice.

225
00:21:07,326 --> 00:21:11,786
You know? I had enough gross guys
for one weekend.

226
00:21:12,932 --> 00:21:14,797
Okay, we'll go.

227
00:21:19,372 --> 00:21:20,964
Do you know of a good place to stay?

228
00:21:22,341 --> 00:21:27,335
-Smart move with the shoes.
-What? It's so easy. You have to try it.

229
00:21:55,641 --> 00:21:57,939
Hi. Can I help you?

230
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:00,635
-I need a room for my friends, please.
-Yeah, cool.

231
00:22:00,846 --> 00:22:02,837
Your passports, please.

232
00:22:06,752 --> 00:22:08,845
American. Good.

233
00:22:09,055 --> 00:22:11,785
Yeah, cool. It's 1 0 Euros for night.

234
00:22:13,492 --> 00:22:15,050
No. I got this one.

235
00:22:15,261 --> 00:22:16,523
No. It's on me.

236
00:22:16,729 --> 00:22:18,993
-Thank you.
-Money.

237
00:22:19,365 --> 00:22:20,992
Thanks.

238
00:22:23,369 --> 00:22:24,734
Here are your keys.

239
00:22:26,305 --> 00:22:29,900
And this is a notice for
the harvest fair tonight, girls.

240
00:22:30,109 --> 00:22:32,942
Will be sexy good times. Come on.

241
00:22:33,145 --> 00:22:35,978
It's Dozinky, I know that.
They have it every year.

242
00:22:36,382 --> 00:22:39,874
-Yeah.
-Lots of music, dancing, costumes.

243
00:22:40,086 --> 00:22:42,145
Oh, my gosh! Could we go?

244
00:22:43,823 --> 00:22:46,314
-lt sounds kind of gay.
-Excuse me.

245
00:22:52,665 --> 00:22:54,997
Oh, we are so going to
the harvest festival.

246
00:22:55,201 --> 00:22:58,534
-Come on. This way.
-Thank you.

247
00:22:59,105 --> 00:23:01,039
You're welcome.

248
00:23:03,943 --> 00:23:06,810
Do you think they have any frescoes
in the room?

249
00:23:28,601 --> 00:23:31,536
Wow, this room feels so timeless.

250
00:23:31,737 --> 00:23:33,637
Are you kidding right now?

251
00:23:36,842 --> 00:23:37,866
Oh, my God!

252
00:23:39,211 --> 00:23:40,974
Sexy.

253
00:23:42,314 --> 00:23:43,713
Come here,

254
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:55,870
Yes! Yes!

255
00:25:56,215 --> 00:25:57,842
Yeah!

256
00:25:58,651 --> 00:26:00,278
That's what I'm talking about, huh?

257
00:26:22,875 --> 00:26:24,570
Todd, what's up?

258
00:26:25,945 --> 00:26:28,937
Yeah, nothing.
We're just finishing up breakfast.

259
00:26:31,483 --> 00:26:32,848
Really?

260
00:26:36,422 --> 00:26:38,322
Wow, I didn't think--

261
00:26:39,959 --> 00:26:42,359
Jesus. You sure?

262
00:26:43,462 --> 00:26:48,525
Yeah, yeah, okay. I can go right now.
I'll tell her I have to meet a client.

263
00:26:49,301 --> 00:26:50,893
Okay.

264
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:52,997
See you.

265
00:27:02,247 --> 00:27:05,375
No respect for me,
No respect for mother earth,

266
00:27:05,584 --> 00:27:08,451
Well, don't you have
anything to say for yourself?

267
00:27:10,255 --> 00:27:12,723
Well, that's just fine,
We can all ride home in silence,

268
00:27:20,232 --> 00:27:23,963
Gosh! This village is so enchanting.

269
00:27:24,436 --> 00:27:26,802
Lorna, are you having a
"journal-gasm" right now?

270
00:27:27,006 --> 00:27:29,031
Actually, yes. Multiple ones.

271
00:27:29,241 --> 00:27:32,267
I get to write about
how beautiful this village is...

272
00:27:32,478 --> 00:27:34,969
...and I get to write about
what a raving bitch you are.

273
00:27:37,583 --> 00:27:39,551
She comes back swinging!

274
00:27:39,752 --> 00:27:42,448
-Well-played.
-Thank you.

275
00:27:45,724 --> 00:27:46,691
Dollar!

276
00:27:47,426 --> 00:27:48,484
Dollar!

277
00:27:48,927 --> 00:27:50,690
Do you guys have a dollar?

278
00:27:50,896 --> 00:27:53,296
-I got it.
-Oh, no, no, no.

279
00:27:53,499 --> 00:27:56,434
No, no, no. I got it. I got it.
Let me.

280
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,974
I have Smints.

281
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:06,639
Would you like a Smint?

282
00:28:19,224 --> 00:28:20,919
Bitches!

283
00:28:27,566 --> 00:28:29,693
Welcome to Slovakia.

284
00:28:37,743 --> 00:28:41,270
You both have corner suites
with views of the river.

285
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,539
Here are your pagers.

286
00:28:43,749 --> 00:28:46,513
Perfect. Thank you.

287
00:28:48,687 --> 00:28:51,417
-You ready to do this?
-Yeah, I'm ready.

288
00:28:52,191 --> 00:28:53,590
Really?

289
00:28:53,792 --> 00:28:56,260
Because you look like
your dog just died.

290
00:28:56,462 --> 00:28:59,158
I'm just jet-lagged, man.
I'll take a shower and I'll feel better.

291
00:28:59,364 --> 00:29:01,594
-All right.
-Thanks.

292
00:29:05,404 --> 00:29:07,702
Oh, my God!

293
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:06,695
Hey, guys!

294
00:30:07,166 --> 00:30:08,190
Yes?

295
00:30:08,667 --> 00:30:10,294
For the apartment.

296
00:30:10,602 --> 00:30:12,536
Awesome, dude.

297
00:30:12,738 --> 00:30:15,434
Those swords are like 1 000 Euros.

298
00:30:15,641 --> 00:30:17,768
Trust me, she can afford it.

299
00:30:18,744 --> 00:30:21,645
Does she get, like,
a really big allowance?

300
00:30:21,947 --> 00:30:24,313
No, it's more like an inheritance.

301
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:28,444
Her mom died when she was 1 2 and,
like, left her everything.

302
00:30:28,654 --> 00:30:30,519
And so she keeps her dad
on an allowance.

303
00:30:31,857 --> 00:30:33,449
-Really?
-Yeah.

304
00:30:34,626 --> 00:30:37,857
She could pretty much buy Slovakia
if she wanted to.

305
00:30:40,199 --> 00:30:42,759
Yeah. It's pretty rad.

306
00:31:09,828 --> 00:31:11,386
Yeah!

307
00:31:12,531 --> 00:31:14,396
Badass.

308
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:17,660
Let me see this motherfucker.

309
00:31:22,741 --> 00:31:24,436
You're up, bro.

310
00:31:28,013 --> 00:31:30,948
I think I'm gonna pass on the tattoo.

311
00:31:31,183 --> 00:31:32,582
Come on, man, sit down.

312
00:31:32,784 --> 00:31:36,151
A tattoo's not really me.
It's not my style.

313
00:31:36,355 --> 00:31:40,155
I didn't know and I don't like needles.
I don't like needles very much.

314
00:31:40,359 --> 00:31:42,850
Dude, what are you doing? Sit down.

315
00:31:43,061 --> 00:31:45,962
Here's the problem. Linda. What
is she gonna say when she sees this?

316
00:31:46,164 --> 00:31:49,565
My wife is not gonna
really understand.

317
00:31:49,768 --> 00:31:52,236
Is there some other option?

318
00:31:53,005 --> 00:31:55,599
Everyone must get tattooed.
Part of contract.

319
00:31:55,974 --> 00:31:56,941
Yeah.

320
00:31:57,175 --> 00:31:58,369
Let's do it. Come on, man.

321
00:31:58,577 --> 00:32:00,602
Why don't you sit down?
These guys aren't playing.

322
00:32:00,913 --> 00:32:03,473
A tattoo is
a little difficult to explain, Todd.

323
00:32:03,682 --> 00:32:05,673
Didn't seem like you had
any problem explaining...

324
00:32:05,884 --> 00:32:08,216
...the gonorrhea you brought back
from Thailand.

325
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:10,911
Can't believe you're bringing up
the gonorrhea. Every time--

326
00:32:11,924 --> 00:32:13,289
Is there any problem here?

327
00:32:13,492 --> 00:32:16,950
No, no. I just didn't know
that this was part of it.

328
00:32:20,565 --> 00:32:21,964
Stuart.

329
00:32:22,167 --> 00:32:26,968
This is not like going to a whorehouse.
You can't just back out.

330
00:32:32,844 --> 00:32:35,642
Get in the fucking chair.

331
00:32:42,321 --> 00:32:43,913
Yeah.

332
00:32:45,991 --> 00:32:48,585
Come on, man. Look at this.

333
00:32:49,027 --> 00:32:51,222
I'm fucking proud of mine.

334
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,680
Look what I found!

335
00:33:11,216 --> 00:33:14,879
Okay, and before you say anything,
it's cider, it's non-alcoholic...

336
00:33:15,087 --> 00:33:17,248
...and those little kids right there
made it.

337
00:33:17,456 --> 00:33:19,117
-Oh, my gosh, really?
-Yeah.

338
00:33:19,324 --> 00:33:21,258
-I'm gonna go say thank you.
-Okay.

339
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:23,860
They don't speak much English.

340
00:33:26,398 --> 00:33:30,767
This is quite possibly the most
alcoholic cider I've ever tasted.

341
00:33:31,069 --> 00:33:32,696
Come on, it's good for her.
She needs it.

342
00:33:32,904 --> 00:33:34,462
Thank you.

343
00:33:36,008 --> 00:33:36,975
Well, cheers.

344
00:33:42,414 --> 00:33:44,143
Oh, my God, my song! Let's go!

345
00:33:45,851 --> 00:33:47,045
Come!

346
00:33:51,757 --> 00:33:54,157
Come on, Borat.
Let's see what you got.

347
00:34:14,413 --> 00:34:15,937
There they are.

348
00:34:16,148 --> 00:34:17,274
Three o'clock.

349
00:34:17,783 --> 00:34:19,444
-Jesus.
-Right?

350
00:34:19,651 --> 00:34:21,881
It's fucking crazy, huh?
Dead ringer.

351
00:34:22,087 --> 00:34:24,487
Happy fucking birthday, bro.

352
00:34:28,126 --> 00:34:31,459
-Dude, where you going?
-ln for a better look.

353
00:34:57,289 --> 00:34:58,256
Me?

354
00:35:39,764 --> 00:35:41,231
Hi.

355
00:35:41,967 --> 00:35:43,093
Hi.

356
00:35:43,335 --> 00:35:46,964
Would you like to dance with me?

357
00:35:48,507 --> 00:35:50,407
No, thank you. I'm--

358
00:35:50,609 --> 00:35:52,042
I'm not nearly drunk enough.

359
00:35:52,244 --> 00:35:53,734
Come on. I'll show you how.

360
00:35:53,945 --> 00:35:56,072
No, really. It's easy.

361
00:35:58,049 --> 00:36:02,349
No. Thank you, really, but my feet.
I'm tired.

362
00:36:05,423 --> 00:36:07,584
I could have helped you.

363
00:36:09,327 --> 00:36:11,124
Excuse me?

364
00:36:18,236 --> 00:36:19,203
Hey.

365
00:36:20,305 --> 00:36:21,533
Hey.

366
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:24,368
That guy make you some troubles?

367
00:36:24,643 --> 00:36:27,043
No. He's fine.

368
00:36:28,747 --> 00:36:30,977
What he say to you?

369
00:36:32,484 --> 00:36:34,714
Nothing. He just wanted to dance.

370
00:36:36,588 --> 00:36:39,148
He won't bother you anymore.

371
00:36:40,091 --> 00:36:42,286
Oh, he wasn't bothering me.

372
00:36:46,431 --> 00:36:49,093
Here. Take a drink.

373
00:36:56,575 --> 00:36:59,772
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

374
00:37:06,518 --> 00:37:08,315
-Oh, I'm so sorry!
-Don't worry about it.

375
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,488
I'm so, so sorry. I'm such an idiot.

376
00:37:10,689 --> 00:37:12,213
No, it's all right.

377
00:37:12,691 --> 00:37:15,387
-Here, let me get you a drink.
-No, you don't need to.

378
00:37:15,594 --> 00:37:16,925
-No, I insist.
-No, no.

379
00:37:17,128 --> 00:37:18,857
I insist.

380
00:37:27,939 --> 00:37:30,134
Beth! Beth!

381
00:37:30,342 --> 00:37:33,778
Beth! Oh, my God, Roman wants to
take me on a boat ride...

382
00:37:33,979 --> 00:37:35,913
...and he's just so suave
and he's amazing...

383
00:37:36,114 --> 00:37:38,844
...and he doesn't speak English,
but we understand each other.

384
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:43,987
Yeah. Just promise me you won't
go on a boat ride with him, okay?

385
00:37:44,189 --> 00:37:45,486
Why not?

386
00:37:45,724 --> 00:37:47,555
What's the big deal?
You don't fancy him?

387
00:37:47,759 --> 00:37:51,354
Just because he's not "Whitney
approved" or "Beth approved" looking?

388
00:37:51,563 --> 00:37:54,862
No, I'm not saying that at all. I just
want you to stay here where it's safe...

389
00:37:55,066 --> 00:37:56,897
...we're all together,
we don't get separated.

390
00:37:57,102 --> 00:37:59,332
Just promise me
you won't go on a boat ride with him.

391
00:38:06,811 --> 00:38:11,271
Lorna, promise me
you won't go on a boat ride with him.

392
00:38:12,417 --> 00:38:16,148
Beth. It's okay.

393
00:38:16,354 --> 00:38:18,652
-Okay. You promise?
-Okay, okay, okay.

394
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:20,489
Okay.

395
00:38:21,893 --> 00:38:23,588
Roman.

396
00:38:24,362 --> 00:38:26,330
Okay, two, please.

397
00:38:28,133 --> 00:38:31,762
-Here you go. I'm so sorry about that.
-It's okay.

398
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:34,336
-Cheers.
-Cheers. Thanks.

399
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:42,036
So, what brings you
to this corner of the world?

400
00:38:42,914 --> 00:38:45,644
Her. Firestarter.

401
00:38:46,851 --> 00:38:48,341
And you?

402
00:38:50,822 --> 00:38:52,983
I honestly don't know.

403
00:38:55,927 --> 00:38:58,521
I'm sorry, there's probably...

404
00:38:58,730 --> 00:39:01,665
...a small army of Slovak boys
all fighting over you.

405
00:39:01,866 --> 00:39:05,495
Why travel all this way
just to talk with an ugly American?

406
00:39:05,704 --> 00:39:07,695
You're not that ugly.

407
00:39:07,906 --> 00:39:09,430
Really?

408
00:39:10,675 --> 00:39:12,233
Well, cheers to that.

409
00:39:12,444 --> 00:39:13,934
Cheers.

410
00:39:14,846 --> 00:39:16,905
Hey, your friend looks like
she's having fun.

411
00:39:18,316 --> 00:39:19,476
Yeah.

412
00:39:19,684 --> 00:39:22,084
I get to listen to them have sex later.

413
00:39:23,788 --> 00:39:26,313
Can we switch?
I'm over at the Dvorzak hotel and...

414
00:39:26,691 --> 00:39:30,354
...it's probably been three centuries
since anybody's had sex over there.

415
00:39:31,563 --> 00:39:33,690
Oh, maybe your table's ready.

416
00:39:35,467 --> 00:39:38,732
That's-- That's a long story.

417
00:39:39,738 --> 00:39:41,569
Well, I'll have to hear about it
another time.

418
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,774
I'm gonna take off,
but it's a small village...

419
00:39:43,975 --> 00:39:45,966
-...I'm sure we'll meet again.
-I'm sure we will.

420
00:39:46,177 --> 00:39:47,940
All right. Good night.

421
00:39:48,413 --> 00:39:49,539
Good night, Beth.

422
00:39:51,149 --> 00:39:52,912
Did I tell you my name?

423
00:39:53,218 --> 00:39:55,379
No, no. I heard your friend use it.

424
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:59,415
But I forgot to tell you mine. I'm Stuart.

425
00:39:59,691 --> 00:40:01,659
Good to meet you, Stuart.

426
00:40:02,193 --> 00:40:03,717
Good night.

427
00:40:14,839 --> 00:40:16,431
Lorna!

428
00:40:19,477 --> 00:40:20,967
Lorna!

429
00:40:27,819 --> 00:40:29,150
Lorna.

430
00:40:30,655 --> 00:40:32,646
Excuse me.

431
00:40:37,962 --> 00:40:39,224
Lorna!

432
00:40:41,633 --> 00:40:42,793
Lorna!

433
00:40:43,802 --> 00:40:45,963
Beth, I'm sorry!

434
00:40:47,038 --> 00:40:48,903
You promised.

435
00:40:49,507 --> 00:40:51,304
I know.

436
00:40:51,509 --> 00:40:53,500
I'm sorry!

437
00:41:32,283 --> 00:41:34,649
It's so peaceful.

438
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,886
It's so secluded.

439
00:41:42,427 --> 00:41:45,021
Roman, what are you doing?

440
00:41:55,406 --> 00:41:56,373
Come to me.

441
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:07,151
Close your eyes.

442
00:42:09,521 --> 00:42:11,512
Roman! Roman!

443
00:42:13,358 --> 00:42:16,350
Roman! Roman!

444
00:42:16,561 --> 00:42:18,893
Roman! Roman!

445
00:42:38,716 --> 00:42:40,843
--on a boat
and I have no idea where she is.

446
00:42:41,052 --> 00:42:44,419
-How does she get back from that?
-Beth, come on!

447
00:42:45,623 --> 00:42:47,488
Oh, fuck!

448
00:42:49,027 --> 00:42:50,756
Beth!

449
00:42:51,462 --> 00:42:53,794
I cannot leave her alone with this guy.

450
00:42:53,998 --> 00:42:57,434
You know, you just go ahead
and I'll wait for Lorna.

451
00:42:57,635 --> 00:42:59,603
-You go. Yeah.
-Yeah?

452
00:42:59,804 --> 00:43:01,669
-All right. Thank you so much.
-Okay.

453
00:43:01,873 --> 00:43:03,363
-Sure. Yeah.
-Thank you.

454
00:43:03,708 --> 00:43:05,005
Fuck!

455
00:43:05,209 --> 00:43:07,973
-Dude, are you coming?
-Are you okay?

456
00:43:08,179 --> 00:43:09,874
I'm good. I'm good. No, I'm fine.

457
00:43:10,081 --> 00:43:11,912
-Are you all right?
-Dude, I'm fine.

458
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:14,275
Have another cocktail.

459
00:43:18,756 --> 00:43:20,621
All right, good night.

460
00:43:21,326 --> 00:43:23,487
No, Whit. We're going to sleep.

461
00:43:23,695 --> 00:43:24,957
-We are?
-Yeah.

462
00:43:25,163 --> 00:43:28,291
Okay, is he hot,
or is he too, like, eastern bloc?

463
00:43:28,499 --> 00:43:31,696
He's fine. But can we please go
get some rest? Come on.

464
00:43:31,903 --> 00:43:33,700
Oh, you're so sweet. No, I'm fine.

465
00:43:33,905 --> 00:43:35,873
It's okay. I'll take care of her.

466
00:43:36,274 --> 00:43:39,869
I'm sure you will, but not tonight,
all right? Good night, Miroslav.

467
00:43:40,078 --> 00:43:42,103
Good night, Miroslav!

468
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:52,456
I'm sorry. He was just so shady.

469
00:43:52,991 --> 00:43:55,516
Whatever. I wanted to fuck him, but....

470
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:59,387
I know you did. I'll make it up to you.

471
00:44:00,131 --> 00:44:03,692
I guess Mr. Rabbit's gonna have to
go down the hole again tonight.

472
00:44:06,604 --> 00:44:08,128
Do you have a AA?

473
00:44:08,573 --> 00:44:10,302
Mr. Rabbit!

474
00:44:10,808 --> 00:44:12,799
Come here, Rabbit!

475
00:44:18,483 --> 00:44:21,111
Do you remember the first guy
in your high school to get laid?

476
00:44:21,319 --> 00:44:22,547
No, but I remember the last.

477
00:44:22,754 --> 00:44:24,915
Well, I do. This kid Greg.

478
00:44:25,123 --> 00:44:29,822
He came back from summer break,
something about him had changed.

479
00:44:30,028 --> 00:44:33,293
It wasn't anything he said or did, but
something was different. You knew it.

480
00:44:33,498 --> 00:44:37,457
I know what you mean. It's like you can
sense it the way an animal senses it.

481
00:44:37,669 --> 00:44:39,159
Exactly. Like an animal.

482
00:44:39,437 --> 00:44:42,895
Sometimes you meet a guy and there's
something fucking scary about him...

483
00:44:43,107 --> 00:44:45,905
...something that makes you think,
"This guy has killed somebody."

484
00:44:46,110 --> 00:44:49,238
He doesn't have to act tough.
He never has to say it.

485
00:44:49,447 --> 00:44:52,075
But like an animal, you can sense it.

486
00:44:52,550 --> 00:44:56,509
You know that this guy's got the balls
to do what few others can.

487
00:44:57,288 --> 00:44:59,313
And that's you after today, my friend.

488
00:44:59,524 --> 00:45:02,584
People are gonna fucking fear you.
Linda is gonna fucking fear you.

489
00:45:02,794 --> 00:45:07,595
What we do today is gonna pay off
every day for the rest of our lives.

490
00:45:08,199 --> 00:45:11,327
-Where's your pager?
-It's back in the room.

491
00:45:11,536 --> 00:45:13,800
-Come on. What the fuck?
-I just figured you had yours.

492
00:45:14,005 --> 00:45:16,803
Is it me? Because it feels like
you're, like, having second thoughts.

493
00:45:17,008 --> 00:45:19,943
You've never really been into this.
I feel like I'm talking you into it.

494
00:45:20,144 --> 00:45:22,704
I don't wanna be doing something
and keep talking about it--

495
00:45:22,914 --> 00:45:27,442
-It's different from taking on an image.
-I am so fucking tired of talking about it.

496
00:45:27,652 --> 00:45:29,950
It's time we fucking do it.

497
00:45:39,397 --> 00:45:40,864
To the next level.

498
00:45:41,065 --> 00:45:43,124
To the next level. No, wait.

499
00:45:43,334 --> 00:45:45,165
Isn't it bad luck to toast with water?

500
00:45:45,369 --> 00:45:49,237
Yeah. Bad luck
for whoever meets us today.

501
00:45:53,945 --> 00:45:56,436
Yeah. Let the games begin.

502
00:46:16,968 --> 00:46:18,526
Hard, hard, hard.

503
00:46:18,736 --> 00:46:20,397
Hey.

504
00:46:20,905 --> 00:46:24,341
-Hey, did she call?
-No. I just checked.

505
00:46:24,909 --> 00:46:27,776
I love that Lorna's the only one of us
that got any action last night.

506
00:46:27,979 --> 00:46:31,346
-Hey, I tried.
-Keep trying.

507
00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:34,675
Yeah, she'd say
this place is majestic.

508
00:46:34,886 --> 00:46:35,853
Sure.

509
00:46:36,053 --> 00:46:37,884
I bet she's making him
breakfast right now.

510
00:46:38,089 --> 00:46:39,613
No, I bet she's in a cum coma.

511
00:46:40,391 --> 00:46:42,086
Thank God.

512
00:46:43,394 --> 00:46:45,692
At least she has something
to write about in her journal.

513
00:50:51,575 --> 00:50:53,065
Please! Please!

514
00:50:53,277 --> 00:50:55,074
Please! Stop!

515
00:50:55,346 --> 00:50:56,472
No!

516
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:59,274
Stop! Please! Please!

517
00:51:06,123 --> 00:51:07,647
Please! Please!

518
00:51:07,858 --> 00:51:10,554
Please, no!

519
00:52:38,582 --> 00:52:40,209
Relax.

520
00:52:44,421 --> 00:52:46,013
Come up here.

521
00:54:18,882 --> 00:54:20,440
Whit?

522
00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:31,057
Axelle?

523
00:54:51,982 --> 00:54:53,540
Fuck.

524
00:54:56,887 --> 00:54:58,411
Whit!

525
00:55:00,324 --> 00:55:02,121
Guys!

526
00:55:06,196 --> 00:55:08,721
Axelle! Whit!

527
00:55:52,810 --> 00:55:54,243
Stop. Please help me!

528
00:55:54,445 --> 00:55:55,935
-Go away.
-Please help me!

529
00:55:56,146 --> 00:55:57,579
-Just go away from me!
-No, no, no.

530
00:55:58,015 --> 00:55:59,949
Help me.
These men are chasing me. Please.

531
00:56:00,150 --> 00:56:03,950
I tried to help, but you don't listen.
Go away!

532
00:56:33,984 --> 00:56:35,747
Dollar, bitch!

533
00:56:44,061 --> 00:56:45,756
Stop!

534
00:57:17,895 --> 00:57:19,453
Get in.

535
00:57:19,696 --> 00:57:21,163
Yeah.

536
00:59:54,651 --> 00:59:57,211
The police will be here soon.

537
00:59:57,854 --> 00:59:59,913
They are looking for your friends.

538
01:00:00,657 --> 01:00:02,284
Thank-- Thank you.

539
01:00:02,893 --> 01:00:04,417
More tea?

540
01:00:04,828 --> 01:00:06,295
Please.

541
01:00:12,002 --> 01:00:13,435
Thank you.

542
01:00:28,585 --> 01:00:30,348
So, you and Sasha...

543
01:00:30,821 --> 01:00:34,222
-...are you two...?
-Oh, no. God, no.

544
01:00:34,424 --> 01:00:36,153
He's old enough to be my dad.

545
01:00:38,428 --> 01:00:40,055
What does he do?

546
01:00:40,263 --> 01:00:42,094
He does auctions.

547
01:00:42,566 --> 01:00:44,966
Come. Let's get you some clothes.

548
01:01:14,031 --> 01:01:15,828
No!

549
01:01:16,033 --> 01:01:17,591
No!

550
01:01:19,636 --> 01:01:22,799
Help! No! No!

551
01:01:41,692 --> 01:01:43,785
What did I do wrong?

552
01:01:46,663 --> 01:01:50,121
Please don't hurt me.
Please don't hurt me. I'm sorry.

553
01:01:50,934 --> 01:01:52,731
Please don't hurt me.
Please don't hurt me.

554
01:01:52,936 --> 01:01:55,131
I not hurt you.

555
01:01:55,472 --> 01:01:57,838
Okay. It's okay.

556
01:01:58,041 --> 01:01:59,201
I clean you up.

557
01:02:00,110 --> 01:02:02,544
Please, please help me.

558
01:02:03,413 --> 01:02:05,404
You have a bruise.

559
01:02:08,485 --> 01:02:10,009
What is that?

560
01:02:10,220 --> 01:02:11,881
What are you doing?

561
01:02:13,623 --> 01:02:15,557
I make you pretty.

562
01:02:16,927 --> 01:02:18,360
Pretty for what?

563
01:02:19,296 --> 01:02:20,991
For the client.

564
01:02:21,331 --> 01:02:23,458
Client? What client?

565
01:02:51,394 --> 01:02:52,725
Give me. No.

566
01:02:52,963 --> 01:02:53,930
No.

567
01:02:57,100 --> 01:02:58,158
We do...

568
01:02:59,035 --> 01:03:00,969
...nails.

569
01:03:23,460 --> 01:03:24,518
No!

570
01:03:34,638 --> 01:03:36,697
No! No!

571
01:03:42,979 --> 01:03:44,810
Oh, my God.

572
01:03:46,416 --> 01:03:47,815
No!

573
01:03:57,794 --> 01:03:59,523
I'm worried about Whit.

574
01:04:01,898 --> 01:04:04,025
Whitney seems like a tough girl.

575
01:04:04,234 --> 01:04:06,202
She'll be okay.

576
01:04:09,706 --> 01:04:11,833
You have a scratch.

577
01:04:13,844 --> 01:04:15,209
Yeah.

578
01:04:24,855 --> 01:04:27,881
-It's sore.
-I'm sorry.

579
01:04:28,892 --> 01:04:31,793
You have such beautiful skin.

580
01:04:31,995 --> 01:04:33,519
Thank you.

581
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:38,360
Who's that?

582
01:04:39,402 --> 01:04:41,370
Just some friends.

583
01:04:42,038 --> 01:04:43,835
Come. You should lie down.

584
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:46,008
I'll wake you up when the police arrive.

585
01:06:46,529 --> 01:06:48,326
Do you think we're sick?

586
01:06:49,866 --> 01:06:51,026
Fuck, no.

587
01:06:51,768 --> 01:06:54,498
Dude, you look anywhere in the world
where there's no law...

588
01:06:55,171 --> 01:06:57,901
...whether it's fucking Chad
or New Orleans...

589
01:06:58,108 --> 01:07:00,133
...and this is the shit
people are doing, bro.

590
01:07:02,345 --> 01:07:04,279
We're the normal ones.

591
01:07:10,553 --> 01:07:12,214
Any idea what
you're gonna do in there?

592
01:07:15,525 --> 01:07:17,584
You don't even wanna know.

593
01:07:19,295 --> 01:07:21,456
You don't even wanna know.

594
01:10:51,007 --> 01:10:52,565
Jesus.

595
01:12:02,912 --> 01:12:04,607
They're listening. They're listening.

596
01:12:06,115 --> 01:12:10,176
Beth, it's me. It's Stuart.
From the fair.

597
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:13,455
Don't talk loud. Okay?

598
01:12:13,656 --> 01:12:16,420
If they hear us talking like this...

599
01:12:16,759 --> 01:12:18,454
...they're gonna fucking kill us both.

600
01:12:19,262 --> 01:12:20,354
You hear me?

601
01:12:20,897 --> 01:12:22,694
I need to know you're listening.

602
01:12:24,300 --> 01:12:25,892
Okay?

603
01:12:40,550 --> 01:12:42,848
What the fuck are you doing?

604
01:12:43,286 --> 01:12:46,585
What is this place?
Where the fuck are we?

605
01:12:47,623 --> 01:12:49,318
Stuart!

606
01:12:51,027 --> 01:12:54,793
Remember when I said that
I didn't know what I was doing here?

607
01:12:56,733 --> 01:12:58,257
Well...

608
01:13:00,136 --> 01:13:02,297
...this is what I'm doing here.

609
01:13:05,341 --> 01:13:06,808
What is this place?

610
01:13:09,045 --> 01:13:10,808
This place....

611
01:13:12,148 --> 01:13:13,945
People come here....

612
01:13:15,718 --> 01:13:17,413
People come here to kill people.

613
01:13:19,021 --> 01:13:22,320
What? Who kills?

614
01:13:23,259 --> 01:13:25,227
Oh, my God, are they gonna kill us?

615
01:13:25,795 --> 01:13:26,989
Well...

616
01:13:28,464 --> 01:13:29,931
...not...

617
01:13:30,133 --> 01:13:31,361
...us.

618
01:13:32,668 --> 01:13:34,602
Oh, my God.

619
01:13:35,071 --> 01:13:37,266
Oh, my God. Are you gonna kill me?

620
01:13:37,473 --> 01:13:40,636
-You're gonna kill me!
-No. No, no! No, no, no.

621
01:13:40,843 --> 01:13:43,937
No. Jesus, no. No.

622
01:13:44,247 --> 01:13:46,545
Then what the fuck
are you doing here?

623
01:13:46,749 --> 01:13:48,307
What the fuck are you wearing?

624
01:13:48,518 --> 01:13:50,509
Someone brought me here...

625
01:13:50,720 --> 01:13:52,449
...the same as you.

626
01:13:53,389 --> 01:13:55,084
Someone I know.

627
01:13:56,426 --> 01:13:57,859
Look...

628
01:13:58,094 --> 01:13:59,823
...he wanted me to--

629
01:14:00,029 --> 01:14:02,691
To do this with him.

630
01:14:03,299 --> 01:14:04,857
What?

631
01:14:05,301 --> 01:14:06,495
Stuart, please.

632
01:14:07,203 --> 01:14:09,364
Please just let me go.
Help me get out of this chair.

633
01:14:09,572 --> 01:14:13,702
Please. Please help me get out of this
chair. Get me out of this chair, please!

634
01:14:36,265 --> 01:14:39,666
You probably used that face to get
whatever the fuck you wanted.

635
01:14:40,169 --> 01:14:42,137
Fucking skank.

636
01:14:55,618 --> 01:14:57,984
Oh, that's fucking rich.

637
01:14:58,788 --> 01:15:01,120
You should see your fucking face.

638
01:15:05,061 --> 01:15:08,326
-We gotta get out of here.
-We can't.

639
01:15:09,065 --> 01:15:11,363
They think you're gonna kill me?

640
01:15:11,868 --> 01:15:14,063
You're not some monster.

641
01:15:15,805 --> 01:15:18,103
-I'm not that guy.
-No.

642
01:15:18,307 --> 01:15:19,535
No, I know.

643
01:15:19,742 --> 01:15:22,302
-I know you're a good person.
-I'm not that guy.

644
01:15:23,045 --> 01:15:25,138
I know. Of course not.

645
01:15:25,348 --> 01:15:27,111
I'm not that guy.

646
01:15:30,419 --> 01:15:33,718
-Okay. Okay.
-I'm not that guy.

647
01:15:36,626 --> 01:15:38,560
We're gonna get out of here.

648
01:15:45,434 --> 01:15:47,334
I'm not that guy.

649
01:15:51,941 --> 01:15:53,966
I'm not that guy.

650
01:15:56,979 --> 01:15:59,004
I'm not that guy.

651
01:16:00,116 --> 01:16:01,879
There must be a co--

652
01:16:24,707 --> 01:16:26,834
Oh, fuck. Fuck.

653
01:16:42,892 --> 01:16:45,554
Christ! Fuck!

654
01:16:46,362 --> 01:16:47,727
God!

655
01:16:49,832 --> 01:16:50,890
Fuck!

656
01:16:52,168 --> 01:16:55,467
Don't you have family?
Don't you have a wife?

657
01:16:56,339 --> 01:16:57,806
My wife?

658
01:16:58,007 --> 01:16:59,702
My wife?

659
01:17:01,944 --> 01:17:03,775
I'm not allowed to kill my wife.

660
01:17:24,233 --> 01:17:26,326
-Finish?
-Yeah, I'm finished, all right.

661
01:17:26,535 --> 01:17:29,402
Hey, hey! You cannot done.

662
01:17:29,605 --> 01:17:31,300
You go in room, finish.

663
01:17:32,041 --> 01:17:33,508
You know what? I am fucking done.

664
01:17:33,709 --> 01:17:36,177
If you don't like it, you can go in
and finish her yourself.

665
01:17:36,379 --> 01:17:38,973
You cannot leave unless
you complete. It's contract.

666
01:17:39,181 --> 01:17:40,808
I fucking paid!

667
01:17:41,017 --> 01:17:42,814
You have my money
and you can keep it!

668
01:17:43,019 --> 01:17:46,386
I am not going back in that room!
I'm done!

669
01:17:46,589 --> 01:17:48,454
Hey! Hey!

670
01:18:47,216 --> 01:18:49,582
Hello. Special offer.

671
01:18:49,785 --> 01:18:53,186
But she's only available
for the next 20 minutes.

672
01:18:53,422 --> 01:18:55,014
Do you want her?

673
01:18:59,895 --> 01:19:01,522
We'll let you know.

674
01:19:42,104 --> 01:19:43,731
Six-fifty.

675
01:20:02,858 --> 01:20:03,825
Yes?

676
01:20:04,360 --> 01:20:09,195
Apologies for interrupting you, but
we have special available right now.

677
01:20:09,398 --> 01:20:10,729
Very good price.

678
01:20:16,605 --> 01:20:18,402
Where's Todd?

679
01:20:30,719 --> 01:20:32,448
Problem with friend.

680
01:20:35,858 --> 01:20:38,156
May I borrow this
for a moment, please?

681
01:20:44,500 --> 01:20:46,024
What do you think?

682
01:20:46,235 --> 01:20:47,930
Should I do it?

683
01:20:48,137 --> 01:20:50,367
I mean, I wouldn't pay
more than a grand for her...

684
01:20:50,573 --> 01:20:52,370
...in this kind of shape, but....

685
01:20:52,575 --> 01:20:54,440
I mean, look at that.

686
01:20:54,643 --> 01:20:56,508
She's not gonna last that long, huh?

687
01:20:58,480 --> 01:21:00,880
You should see
what she did to my friend.

688
01:21:06,222 --> 01:21:07,621
I'll take her.

689
01:21:48,631 --> 01:21:50,895
A souvenir from your friend.

690
01:22:01,043 --> 01:22:03,102
Notice anything different about me?

691
01:22:05,848 --> 01:22:07,907
I bet you fucking do.

692
01:22:08,984 --> 01:22:10,781
Fucking bitch.

693
01:22:15,557 --> 01:22:17,684
Fucking respect me now.

694
01:22:19,561 --> 01:22:21,961
I don't fucking work for you!

695
01:22:23,132 --> 01:22:26,260
I don't work all fucking day
for you to humiliate me.

696
01:22:29,972 --> 01:22:31,132
To tell me I'm shit.

697
01:22:35,477 --> 01:22:36,910
Never fuck me.

698
01:22:38,314 --> 01:22:39,872
Look at you.

699
01:22:40,416 --> 01:22:41,713
What?

700
01:22:41,917 --> 01:22:44,909
What, you got something to say?
Do you? You do, bitch?

701
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:48,521
Yeah? Oh, good.
Well, it better be fucking good.

702
01:22:48,958 --> 01:22:52,450
-Let's fucking hear it. What?
-I'm not your wife.

703
01:22:52,661 --> 01:22:56,427
I'm not your wife, Stuart.
I'm not your wife.

704
01:22:57,466 --> 01:23:02,130
She doesn't understand you.
She doesn't understand you like I do.

705
01:23:02,338 --> 01:23:05,501
-And I see how you're strong.
-I am strong.

706
01:23:05,708 --> 01:23:08,438
-I am fucking Hercules!
-I see.

707
01:23:09,378 --> 01:23:11,938
I know. I know. I see it. I see it.

708
01:23:12,314 --> 01:23:13,713
I saw it last night.

709
01:23:13,916 --> 01:23:17,477
I was hoping you would kiss me.
I wanted you to kiss me.

710
01:23:19,254 --> 01:23:21,620
I thought about you all night.

711
01:23:28,664 --> 01:23:30,825
Get on the fucking floor.

712
01:23:40,809 --> 01:23:42,208
Are you scared?

713
01:23:45,180 --> 01:23:47,171
You fucking better be.

714
01:23:48,884 --> 01:23:50,442
I am.

715
01:23:51,353 --> 01:23:53,150
I like it.

716
01:24:07,269 --> 01:24:08,827
Look at me.

717
01:24:11,106 --> 01:24:12,471
Bitch.

718
01:24:13,842 --> 01:24:16,572
You fucking whore.

719
01:24:41,570 --> 01:24:43,401
Get in the chair!

720
01:24:43,605 --> 01:24:45,402
Get in the fucking chair!

721
01:24:49,611 --> 01:24:51,078
Fucker!

722
01:25:08,464 --> 01:25:09,431
What's the code?

723
01:25:09,765 --> 01:25:11,596
Fuck you!

724
01:25:15,704 --> 01:25:17,262
What's the fucking code?

725
01:25:20,909 --> 01:25:22,672
-Your birthday.
-What?

726
01:25:22,878 --> 01:25:24,675
What is your birthday?

727
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:26,814
December 1 2th.

728
01:25:28,484 --> 01:25:31,112
Oh, that is fucking sick.

729
01:25:47,903 --> 01:25:49,336
What the fuck? It's not opening.

730
01:25:51,140 --> 01:25:53,836
It's not fucking opening!

731
01:25:54,042 --> 01:25:55,907
Oh, yes, it is.

732
01:25:57,179 --> 01:26:00,205
Do it! She's right up there
behind you! Kill her!

733
01:26:00,415 --> 01:26:03,213
Motherfucker! Shoot her!

734
01:26:03,552 --> 01:26:05,952
Kill her! Kill her!

735
01:26:09,224 --> 01:26:10,953
Don't shoot!
Be careful, for God's sakes!

736
01:26:11,160 --> 01:26:13,151
She'll cut! She'll fucking cut!
Don't shoot!

737
01:26:13,362 --> 01:26:14,693
Fucking she'll cut! She'll cut!

738
01:26:15,931 --> 01:26:17,262
Get Sasha!

739
01:26:17,499 --> 01:26:21,367
You gotta do it! I'm the fucking
customer here! Do it, for fuck's sake.

740
01:26:21,570 --> 01:26:23,401
Jesus fucking Christ. Oh, shit!

741
01:26:23,605 --> 01:26:24,663
-Sasha!
-Get him!

742
01:26:42,524 --> 01:26:44,424
-Wait! I wanna buy my way out of here.
-Wait!

743
01:26:47,796 --> 01:26:50,788
-You can't afford it.
-Don't tell me what I can't afford.

744
01:26:50,999 --> 01:26:55,163
There's nothing I can't afford. I could
buy and sell everyone in this room.

745
01:26:56,305 --> 01:26:58,500
You going to call your parents
for money?

746
01:26:58,707 --> 01:27:00,800
No, motherfucker, it's my money.

747
01:27:01,009 --> 01:27:04,001
Just get me a PDA, a SWlFT number
and a recipient name.

748
01:27:04,213 --> 01:27:07,080
I have accounts in Switzerland,
Luxembourg and the lsle of Man.

749
01:27:07,282 --> 01:27:11,343
Just name your fucking price!
Trust me, I got it.

750
01:27:13,222 --> 01:27:14,746
Okay.

751
01:27:20,295 --> 01:27:21,421
We negotiate.

752
01:27:22,698 --> 01:27:25,531
-This is bullshit!
-This is business.

753
01:27:25,834 --> 01:27:26,892
I'll pay more!

754
01:27:27,336 --> 01:27:29,304
Not with a second mortgage
on your house...

755
01:27:29,504 --> 01:27:31,563
...and your daughter's
private-school tuition.

756
01:27:32,040 --> 01:27:33,735
That's why your friend pay.

757
01:27:33,942 --> 01:27:35,807
What's the number?

758
01:27:36,945 --> 01:27:39,345
Money is not the only issue.

759
01:27:39,548 --> 01:27:41,175
We have contract here.

760
01:27:41,984 --> 01:27:43,417
What kind of contract?

761
01:27:44,886 --> 01:27:47,514
Anyone who come to this place...

762
01:27:47,723 --> 01:27:49,350
...cannot leave...

763
01:27:49,558 --> 01:27:51,116
...without killing.

764
01:27:52,060 --> 01:27:55,587
They're still gonna kill you,
you fucking stupid cunt.

765
01:27:56,999 --> 01:27:58,728
What did you say to me?

766
01:28:00,669 --> 01:28:03,467
You're a stupid fucking cu--!

767
01:28:20,355 --> 01:28:21,720
Let him bleed to death.

768
01:28:23,492 --> 01:28:24,516
Misha, no!

769
01:29:05,133 --> 01:29:07,067
Isn't this great?

770
01:29:13,408 --> 01:29:15,672
Hey, get back here!

771
01:29:17,846 --> 01:29:19,040
Wait!

772
01:29:19,247 --> 01:29:21,147
Wait! Wait!

773
01:29:22,918 --> 01:29:24,100
Wait!

774
01:29:25,153 --> 01:29:26,120
Hey!

775
01:29:26,555 --> 01:29:29,149
You fucking shit! Wait!

776
01:34:31,226 --> 01:34:33,126
Bitches!
