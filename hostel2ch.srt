1
00:03:15,994 --> 00:03:19,020
He say, "Good morning,"
and ask, "How is your hand?"

2
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:22,688
It's-- It's better.

3
00:03:22,934 --> 00:03:24,128
What's left of it.

4
00:03:27,172 --> 00:03:28,605
Sorry.

5
00:03:28,873 --> 00:03:31,637
We would like to speak with you
if you feel well enough.

6
00:03:31,843 --> 00:03:33,970
Yeah, that's all right.

7
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:38,574
-Coffee?
-No, thank you.

8
00:03:41,486 --> 00:03:44,853
Tell us about this place you mention,
in Slovakia.

9
00:03:46,157 --> 00:03:47,988
It's this....

10
00:03:48,893 --> 00:03:50,758
It's some kind of factory...

11
00:03:51,329 --> 00:03:53,797
,,,where these people,
these very rich people,,,

12
00:03:53,999 --> 00:03:57,059
,,,they pay to torture and kill kids,

13
00:03:57,602 --> 00:03:59,297
Mostly backpackers,

14
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,372
And they killed two of my friends.

15
00:04:20,392 --> 00:04:21,984
They take you from this hostel...

16
00:04:23,061 --> 00:04:25,689
,,,and they bring you
to this factory and,,,,

17
00:04:27,298 --> 00:04:30,062
I went there looking for Josh,

18
00:04:30,268 --> 00:04:34,705
He was one of my friends
and they took him there and....

19
00:04:37,442 --> 00:04:39,273
And they,,,,

20
00:04:39,477 --> 00:04:40,444
They killed him,

21
00:04:44,115 --> 00:04:45,810
It was horrible.

22
00:04:57,595 --> 00:04:59,324
He ask how you survive.

23
00:05:03,835 --> 00:05:04,802
I....

24
00:05:13,845 --> 00:05:15,745
I escaped.

25
00:05:26,658 --> 00:05:28,751
Who organize this place?

26
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:34,330
I don't know.
It's some kind of hunting club. They....

27
00:05:34,866 --> 00:05:37,926
They all have the same tattoo.

28
00:05:38,136 --> 00:05:39,228
It's a dog,

29
00:05:39,437 --> 00:05:40,961
It's a bloodhound dog,

30
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,245
Strange that you mention this tattoo.

31
00:05:59,591 --> 00:06:00,649
Why?

32
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:14,203
Because someone was found dead
in a train station bathroom in Vienna...

33
00:06:14,405 --> 00:06:16,805
...with this same bloodhound tattoo
you describe.

34
00:06:24,182 --> 00:06:28,312
Security tapes from this station
show him entering from a platform...

35
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:32,650
...where a train arrive earlier that day
from Slovakia.

36
00:06:32,857 --> 00:06:35,348
It came through
the same station in Vienna.

37
00:06:39,864 --> 00:06:41,832
You were on that tape.

38
00:06:47,672 --> 00:06:51,472
Did his tattoo look something like this?

39
00:06:51,976 --> 00:06:53,603
What the fuck's going on?

40
00:06:53,812 --> 00:06:56,007
Help! Somebody help me!

41
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,886
Jesus.

42
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:22,997
You hungry?

43
00:07:23,474 --> 00:07:25,499
It's 3:1 5 in the morning.

44
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:28,406
I have to take these with food.
I wanna know if you want anything.

45
00:07:28,646 --> 00:07:31,547
Yeah, I want you to talk to someone.

46
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:34,643
When are you gonna tell
Josh's mother what happened?

47
00:07:34,853 --> 00:07:36,150
I'm not.

48
00:07:38,489 --> 00:07:40,320
She still thinks her son's in Europe.

49
00:07:40,525 --> 00:07:42,789
What the fuck
am I supposed to tell her?

50
00:07:42,994 --> 00:07:46,020
-She'll go straight to the police.
-Yeah, exactly. Someone should.

51
00:07:46,231 --> 00:07:50,361
No, no one should. You don't get it.
These people are tied into everyone.

52
00:07:50,568 --> 00:07:52,001
Somebody starts asking questions...

53
00:07:52,203 --> 00:07:54,068
...they're gonna come after me
and find me.

54
00:07:54,472 --> 00:07:58,306
At my grandmother's house? I've
been coming here since I was a kid.

55
00:07:58,509 --> 00:08:01,307
I can barely find the place.
I had to ask my sister for directions.

56
00:08:01,512 --> 00:08:03,537
-You told your sister we were here?
-Yeah. So?

57
00:08:03,748 --> 00:08:06,239
-Well, who else knows?
-No one!

58
00:08:06,451 --> 00:08:07,918
Jesus.

59
00:08:09,053 --> 00:08:11,544
I'm doing this for your protection too.
You know that, right?

60
00:08:11,756 --> 00:08:14,088
Oh, Paxton....

61
00:08:16,427 --> 00:08:17,416
Look.

62
00:08:18,029 --> 00:08:20,429
I took you back because I felt bad.

63
00:08:20,965 --> 00:08:23,365
But you're going crazy.

64
00:08:23,568 --> 00:08:27,026
You wake up every night screaming,
and I can't sleep.

65
00:08:27,238 --> 00:08:28,830
Well, that won't
be a problem anymore.

66
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,667
Paxton, that's not what l--

67
00:08:31,643 --> 00:08:34,009
Oh, fuck.

68
00:09:04,342 --> 00:09:06,003
Morning!

69
00:09:25,029 --> 00:09:26,860
Paxton?

70
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,268
Hey.

71
00:10:56,554 --> 00:10:58,021
Lorna?

72
00:10:58,322 --> 00:10:59,880
Lorna?

73
00:11:02,193 --> 00:11:05,594
Sorry. I was trying to be
in the moment.

74
00:11:05,797 --> 00:11:07,765
Absorb.

75
00:11:13,137 --> 00:11:16,231
Do you think she ever saw a cock
before this class?

76
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:18,736
If she did, it was in a Botticelli.

77
00:11:18,943 --> 00:11:20,205
Oh, my God.

78
00:11:20,411 --> 00:11:24,279
If I hear her talk about how emotional
the Botticelllis are one more time...

79
00:11:24,482 --> 00:11:27,246
...I swear to God,
I'm gonna choke the bitch to death.

80
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,491
Until Tuesday.

81
00:11:37,695 --> 00:11:39,094
Are you all packed for Prague?

82
00:11:39,297 --> 00:11:41,697
-Jeans. No heels.
-Awesome.

83
00:11:41,899 --> 00:11:44,390
I can't do it on the cobblestone.
I don't know how you do it.

84
00:11:44,602 --> 00:11:46,695
I can teach you if you bring heels.

85
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:53,575
Axelle.

86
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:05,451
Hands on your pencils, boys.

87
00:12:20,138 --> 00:12:22,470
-Would he ever?
-Excuse me, girls.

88
00:12:22,673 --> 00:12:23,970
-Excuse me. Hi.
-Hi.

89
00:12:24,175 --> 00:12:26,871
-May I see?
-Oh, they're just rough.

90
00:12:27,078 --> 00:12:29,603
Show her. Don't be shy.

91
00:12:33,217 --> 00:12:34,514
That's the one of you.

92
00:12:34,752 --> 00:12:38,119
-Oh, wow, that's beautiful.
-Thanks.

93
00:12:38,322 --> 00:12:39,812
How much would you want for it?

94
00:12:40,024 --> 00:12:41,958
I wouldn't sell them.
You can have this one.

95
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,650
-Really?
-Yeah.

96
00:12:43,861 --> 00:12:47,126
-Oh, my God, thank you so much.
-You're welcome.

97
00:12:47,331 --> 00:12:49,526
Can I buy you a drink or something?

98
00:12:49,734 --> 00:12:53,170
Oh, I'm actually late. We're
catching a train to Prague, but....

99
00:12:53,371 --> 00:12:55,703
-I don't know. Maybe some other time.
-Okay.

100
00:12:55,907 --> 00:12:57,738
-Yeah! Okay.
-Okay.

101
00:12:57,942 --> 00:13:01,343
-I'll see you.
-All right. Bye. Thanks.

102
00:13:09,687 --> 00:13:12,019
No, Dad. It's Prague.
We're gonna be fine.

103
00:13:12,223 --> 00:13:14,088
It's not the Ukraine.

104
00:13:16,527 --> 00:13:17,994
No.

105
00:13:19,964 --> 00:13:22,296
No, Dad,
do not book the Four Seasons.

106
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,933
Book it, bitch. Book it. Please!

107
00:13:24,135 --> 00:13:28,094
Because, Dad, no college students
are staying at the Four Seasons.

108
00:13:28,306 --> 00:13:32,902
And, you know, it's for old people.
So thank you, but please don't.

109
00:13:33,678 --> 00:13:35,043
What?

110
00:13:38,182 --> 00:13:40,582
Yeah. Yes, we have chaperones.

111
00:13:40,785 --> 00:13:42,616
Okay, love you. Bye.

112
00:13:43,087 --> 00:13:45,749
Jesus, I hate that he calls
every fucking five minutes.

113
00:13:45,957 --> 00:13:49,120
-All right, let's go.
-Hold on. We gotta wait for someone.

114
00:13:49,727 --> 00:13:51,058
Who?

115
00:13:54,165 --> 00:13:55,189
-Yeah.
-No.

116
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:56,457
-Yeah.
-No.

117
00:13:56,667 --> 00:13:59,295
She cornered me in the apartment.
She's homesick, crying.

118
00:13:59,503 --> 00:14:01,130
I felt bad. What am I supposed to say?

119
00:14:01,339 --> 00:14:04,536
She's homesick for Baltimore?
We're in Rome, for fuck's sake.

120
00:14:04,742 --> 00:14:06,369
She's not that bad.

121
00:14:22,493 --> 00:14:24,586
Wow, is that a new journal
you got there?

122
00:14:25,463 --> 00:14:27,590
Yeah. It's a travel journal.

123
00:14:27,798 --> 00:14:29,322
For emotional callbacks.

124
00:14:30,301 --> 00:14:31,495
Of course.

125
00:14:33,004 --> 00:14:34,938
Lorna, we're gonna grab a drink.
You wanna go?

126
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:37,105
I'm okay. Thank you.

127
00:14:38,009 --> 00:14:41,274
All right.
Well, we'll see you in a little bit. Okay.

128
00:14:42,847 --> 00:14:44,007
Knock yourself out, buddy.

129
00:14:44,282 --> 00:14:45,806
See you later.

130
00:14:57,728 --> 00:15:00,629
Excuse you. Asshole.

131
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:13,971
She's like a 20-year-old grandmother.

132
00:15:14,178 --> 00:15:16,271
Whatever. She'll watch our stuff.
She's happy there.

133
00:15:16,647 --> 00:15:18,774
That's what she likes to do.

134
00:15:18,983 --> 00:15:20,382
Oh, we didn't order these.

135
00:15:20,584 --> 00:15:22,381
They're from girl.

136
00:15:25,656 --> 00:15:27,715
Whoa, your girlfriend's stalking us.

137
00:15:29,327 --> 00:15:31,022
Hey. What are you doing?

138
00:15:31,495 --> 00:15:33,656
You inspired me to take a trip.

139
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,501
Watch this.

140
00:15:47,445 --> 00:15:49,436
You've got to be kidding me.

141
00:15:49,814 --> 00:15:51,076
Hello. What's your name?

142
00:15:59,123 --> 00:16:02,752
Do you know where we could score,
like, party favors?

143
00:16:03,394 --> 00:16:04,486
What do you need?

144
00:16:04,695 --> 00:16:07,858
I don't know.
Like, bud and ecstasy and, like....

145
00:16:09,367 --> 00:16:10,698
PCP?

146
00:16:10,901 --> 00:16:13,199
Ice? Peyote? Crank?

147
00:16:13,404 --> 00:16:15,565
Okay, okay, bud and X are good.

148
00:16:17,975 --> 00:16:19,340
Sure.

149
00:16:20,411 --> 00:16:23,938
We go back to my car. I got some.

150
00:16:24,315 --> 00:16:25,543
Yeah?

151
00:16:26,884 --> 00:16:29,114
-Yeah?
-Okay.

152
00:16:39,397 --> 00:16:42,093
Fuck. You know what?

153
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:46,631
I'm trying but I can't find them.
Just hang on, yeah?

154
00:16:51,575 --> 00:16:54,408
-You want drink?
-No, I'm fine.

155
00:17:04,555 --> 00:17:05,647
Hey, you know what?

156
00:17:05,856 --> 00:17:08,984
It's okay because we can just get
it at the club when we go to Prague.

157
00:17:09,193 --> 00:17:11,127
No, stay.

158
00:17:12,863 --> 00:17:15,388
I find them. Okay?

159
00:17:20,838 --> 00:17:22,829
You smell nice.

160
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:27,737
-Whit, we gotta go. Lorna's waiting.
-Yeah, we have our friend.

161
00:17:27,945 --> 00:17:29,276
-You have friend?
-Yeah.

162
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,813
One, two, three, perfetto, Otherwise,
we have to take turns, huh?

163
00:17:36,387 --> 00:17:38,150
You know, we're gonna go,
so never mind.

164
00:17:38,355 --> 00:17:42,655
Where you go? I knew you were
a tease, you fucking cunt.

165
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:44,157
What the fuck did you call me?

166
00:17:44,361 --> 00:17:47,159
I called you
stupid fucking American cunt!

167
00:17:47,364 --> 00:17:48,524
-Fuck you!
-You know what?

168
00:17:48,732 --> 00:17:52,224
The train to fucking Prague
is long, you bitch.

169
00:17:52,436 --> 00:17:54,131
We'll come see you.

170
00:17:54,772 --> 00:17:56,205
Are you fucking insane?

171
00:17:56,407 --> 00:17:57,772
What? I fucking hate that word.

172
00:17:57,975 --> 00:18:00,307
"Oh, you stupid American cunt."
I fucking lost my temper.

173
00:18:00,511 --> 00:18:02,775
Okay, but it's not like
we're on campus and you can...

174
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:05,574
...call the dean
and file a report or something.

175
00:18:10,588 --> 00:18:12,783
Oh, my God. Lorna, what happened?

176
00:18:13,224 --> 00:18:15,158
Some guy took my iPod.

177
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:16,553
What?

178
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:19,558
Is there, like, a police officer
on the train or something?

179
00:18:20,064 --> 00:18:22,259
-Yeah. I'll go check.
-Okay.

180
00:18:24,101 --> 00:18:25,363
It had everything.

181
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:29,071
That's awful. I'm so sorry.

182
00:18:30,741 --> 00:18:32,436
I'm sorry.

183
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,038
Here you go.

184
00:18:52,429 --> 00:18:53,987
It's those fucking guys.

185
00:18:54,198 --> 00:18:57,292
The fucking guys, the ltalian guys
from the room down the hall.

186
00:18:58,035 --> 00:19:00,196
-What do we do?
-Just be quiet.

187
00:19:08,946 --> 00:19:09,970
-Hi.
-Hi.

188
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:12,512
Excuse me.
Did one of you girls lose this?

189
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:14,715
Oh, my God!

190
00:19:15,386 --> 00:19:17,149
How did you know this was mine?

191
00:19:17,354 --> 00:19:20,551
I saw some guy run out of your room.
He tried to take my bag.

192
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:23,358
I fought him off
and this felled out of his pocket.

193
00:19:23,894 --> 00:19:26,294
I'm a little worried he might
come back looking for me.

194
00:19:26,497 --> 00:19:28,965
Well, do you wanna come in here
and hang out with us?

195
00:19:29,199 --> 00:19:31,030
-Really?
-Yeah, we have an extra seat.

196
00:19:31,235 --> 00:19:32,361
-Yeah, come in.
-Totally.

197
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:33,730
Thank you.

198
00:19:36,707 --> 00:19:38,334
I think...

199
00:19:38,542 --> 00:19:40,407
...we all need a little of this.

200
00:19:41,378 --> 00:19:42,811
Oh, awesome.

201
00:19:44,214 --> 00:19:46,375
Oh, no, thanks. I don't drink.

202
00:19:46,917 --> 00:19:48,509
Thank you.

203
00:19:48,819 --> 00:19:51,219
As my father always says:

204
00:19:51,455 --> 00:19:53,650
"Nazdrovia." To your health.

205
00:20:07,104 --> 00:20:09,834
So are you going to Prague
for the football match?

206
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,837
I kind of wanna go home.

207
00:20:12,042 --> 00:20:16,502
Oh, I don't blame you. I got
robbed twice on the overnight train.

208
00:20:16,714 --> 00:20:18,579
There are so few safe places
left in Europe.

209
00:20:19,216 --> 00:20:20,478
So where are you going?

210
00:20:21,585 --> 00:20:23,143
On a little spa vacation.

211
00:20:23,687 --> 00:20:24,654
Where?

212
00:20:25,189 --> 00:20:26,417
Slovakia.

213
00:20:26,624 --> 00:20:28,854
Wait, wasn't there, like,
some war in Slovakia?

214
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:33,191
There hasn't been war in Slovakia
for 50 years.

215
00:20:33,397 --> 00:20:34,625
That's Bosnia, darling.

216
00:20:34,832 --> 00:20:37,130
-Oh, like you knew.
-I did so.

217
00:20:37,334 --> 00:20:38,858
What are the spas like there?

218
00:20:39,069 --> 00:20:42,698
They're the best natural hot springs
in the world.

219
00:20:42,906 --> 00:20:46,967
I go twice a year. It's great to get away
from the ltalian guys.

220
00:20:47,177 --> 00:20:48,508
They get to be a bit much.

221
00:20:49,713 --> 00:20:51,704
Wow, hot springs?

222
00:20:51,915 --> 00:20:55,282
That sounds so therapeutic.
I wanna go.

223
00:20:55,486 --> 00:20:59,013
It's very easy. You just have to
switch trains in Prague.

224
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:02,420
It could be nice.

225
00:21:02,726 --> 00:21:07,186
You know? I had enough gross guys
for one weekend.

226
00:21:08,332 --> 00:21:10,197
Okay, we'll go.

227
00:21:14,772 --> 00:21:16,364
Do you know of a good place to stay?

228
00:21:17,741 --> 00:21:22,735
-Smart move with the shoes.
-What? It's so easy. You have to try it.

229
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:53,339
Hi. Can I help you?

230
00:21:53,544 --> 00:21:56,035
-I need a room for my friends, please.
-Yeah, cool.

231
00:21:56,246 --> 00:21:58,237
Your passports, please.

232
00:22:02,152 --> 00:22:04,245
American. Good.

233
00:22:04,455 --> 00:22:07,185
Yeah, cool. It's 1 0 Euros for night.

234
00:22:08,892 --> 00:22:10,450
No. I got this one.

235
00:22:10,661 --> 00:22:11,923
No. It's on me.

236
00:22:12,129 --> 00:22:14,393
-Thank you.
-Money.

237
00:22:14,765 --> 00:22:16,392
Thanks.

238
00:22:18,769 --> 00:22:20,134
Here are your keys.

239
00:22:21,705 --> 00:22:25,300
And this is a notice for
the harvest fair tonight, girls.

240
00:22:25,509 --> 00:22:28,342
Will be sexy good times. Come on.

241
00:22:28,545 --> 00:22:31,378
It's Dozinky, I know that.
They have it every year.

242
00:22:31,782 --> 00:22:35,274
-Yeah.
-Lots of music, dancing, costumes.

243
00:22:35,486 --> 00:22:37,545
Oh, my gosh! Could we go?

244
00:22:39,223 --> 00:22:41,714
-lt sounds kind of gay.
-Excuse me.

245
00:22:48,065 --> 00:22:50,397
Oh, we are so going to
the harvest festival.

246
00:22:50,601 --> 00:22:53,934
-Come on. This way.
-Thank you.

247
00:22:54,505 --> 00:22:56,439
You're welcome.

248
00:22:59,343 --> 00:23:02,210
Do you think they have any frescoes
in the room?

249
00:23:24,001 --> 00:23:26,936
Wow, this room feels so timeless.

250
00:23:27,137 --> 00:23:29,037
Are you kidding right now?

251
00:23:32,242 --> 00:23:33,266
Oh, my God!

252
00:23:34,611 --> 00:23:36,374
Sexy.

253
00:23:37,714 --> 00:23:39,113
Come here,

254
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:51,270
Yes! Yes!

255
00:25:51,615 --> 00:25:53,242
Yeah!

256
00:25:54,051 --> 00:25:55,678
That's what I'm talking about, huh?

257
00:26:18,275 --> 00:26:19,970
Todd, what's up?

258
00:26:21,345 --> 00:26:24,337
Yeah, nothing.
We're just finishing up breakfast.

259
00:26:26,883 --> 00:26:28,248
Really?

260
00:26:31,822 --> 00:26:33,722
Wow, I didn't think--

261
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:37,759
Jesus. You sure?

262
00:26:38,862 --> 00:26:43,925
Yeah, yeah, okay. I can go right now.
I'll tell her I have to meet a client.

263
00:26:44,701 --> 00:26:46,293
Okay.

264
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:48,397
See you.

265
00:26:57,647 --> 00:27:00,775
No respect for me,
No respect for mother earth,

266
00:27:00,984 --> 00:27:03,851
Well, don't you have
anything to say for yourself?

267
00:27:05,655 --> 00:27:08,123
Well, that's just fine,
We can all ride home in silence,

268
00:27:15,632 --> 00:27:19,363
Gosh! This village is so enchanting.

269
00:27:19,836 --> 00:27:22,202
Lorna, are you having a
"journal-gasm" right now?

270
00:27:22,406 --> 00:27:24,431
Actually, yes. Multiple ones.

271
00:27:24,641 --> 00:27:27,667
I get to write about
how beautiful this village is...

272
00:27:27,878 --> 00:27:30,369
...and I get to write about
what a raving bitch you are.

273
00:27:32,983 --> 00:27:34,951
She comes back swinging!

274
00:27:35,152 --> 00:27:37,848
-Well-played.
-Thank you.

275
00:27:41,124 --> 00:27:42,091
Dollar!

276
00:27:42,826 --> 00:27:43,884
Dollar!

277
00:27:44,327 --> 00:27:46,090
Do you guys have a dollar?

278
00:27:46,296 --> 00:27:48,696
-I got it.
-Oh, no, no, no.

279
00:27:48,899 --> 00:27:51,834
No, no, no. I got it. I got it.
Let me.

280
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,374
I have Smints.

281
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:02,039
Would you like a Smint?

282
00:28:14,624 --> 00:28:16,319
Bitches!

283
00:28:22,966 --> 00:28:25,093
Welcome to Slovakia.

284
00:28:33,143 --> 00:28:36,670
You both have corner suites
with views of the river.

285
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,939
Here are your pagers.

286
00:28:39,149 --> 00:28:41,913
Perfect. Thank you.

287
00:28:44,087 --> 00:28:46,817
-You ready to do this?
-Yeah, I'm ready.

288
00:28:47,591 --> 00:28:48,990
Really?

289
00:28:49,192 --> 00:28:51,660
Because you look like
your dog just died.

290
00:28:51,862 --> 00:28:54,558
I'm just jet-lagged, man.
I'll take a shower and I'll feel better.

291
00:28:54,764 --> 00:28:56,994
-All right.
-Thanks.

292
00:29:00,804 --> 00:29:03,102
Oh, my God!

293
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:02,095
Hey, guys!

294
00:30:02,566 --> 00:30:03,590
Yes?

295
00:30:04,067 --> 00:30:05,694
For the apartment.

296
00:30:06,002 --> 00:30:07,936
Awesome, dude.

297
00:30:08,138 --> 00:30:10,834
Those swords are like 1 000 Euros.

298
00:30:11,041 --> 00:30:13,168
Trust me, she can afford it.

299
00:30:14,144 --> 00:30:17,045
Does she get, like,
a really big allowance?

300
00:30:17,347 --> 00:30:19,713
No, it's more like an inheritance.

301
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:23,844
Her mom died when she was 1 2 and,
like, left her everything.

302
00:30:24,054 --> 00:30:25,919
And so she keeps her dad
on an allowance.

303
00:30:27,257 --> 00:30:28,849
-Really?
-Yeah.

304
00:30:30,026 --> 00:30:33,257
She could pretty much buy Slovakia
if she wanted to.

305
00:30:35,599 --> 00:30:38,159
Yeah. It's pretty rad.

306
00:31:05,228 --> 00:31:06,786
Yeah!

307
00:31:07,931 --> 00:31:09,796
Badass.

308
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:13,060
Let me see this motherfucker.

309
00:31:18,141 --> 00:31:19,836
You're up, bro.

310
00:31:23,413 --> 00:31:26,348
I think I'm gonna pass on the tattoo.

311
00:31:26,583 --> 00:31:27,982
Come on, man, sit down.

312
00:31:28,184 --> 00:31:31,551
A tattoo's not really me.
It's not my style.

313
00:31:31,755 --> 00:31:35,555
I didn't know and I don't like needles.
I don't like needles very much.

314
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:38,250
Dude, what are you doing? Sit down.

315
00:31:38,461 --> 00:31:41,362
Here's the problem. Linda. What
is she gonna say when she sees this?

316
00:31:41,564 --> 00:31:44,965
My wife is not gonna
really understand.

317
00:31:45,168 --> 00:31:47,636
Is there some other option?

318
00:31:48,405 --> 00:31:50,999
Everyone must get tattooed.
Part of contract.

319
00:31:51,374 --> 00:31:52,341
Yeah.

320
00:31:52,575 --> 00:31:53,769
Let's do it. Come on, man.

321
00:31:53,977 --> 00:31:56,002
Why don't you sit down?
These guys aren't playing.

322
00:31:56,313 --> 00:31:58,873
A tattoo is
a little difficult to explain, Todd.

323
00:31:59,082 --> 00:32:01,073
Didn't seem like you had
any problem explaining...

324
00:32:01,284 --> 00:32:03,616
...the gonorrhea you brought back
from Thailand.

325
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:06,311
Can't believe you're bringing up
the gonorrhea. Every time--

326
00:32:07,324 --> 00:32:08,689
Is there any problem here?

327
00:32:08,892 --> 00:32:12,350
No, no. I just didn't know
that this was part of it.

328
00:32:15,965 --> 00:32:17,364
Stuart.

329
00:32:17,567 --> 00:32:22,368
This is not like going to a whorehouse.
You can't just back out.

330
00:32:28,244 --> 00:32:31,042
Get in the fucking chair.

331
00:32:37,721 --> 00:32:39,313
Yeah.

332
00:32:41,391 --> 00:32:43,985
Come on, man. Look at this.

333
00:32:44,427 --> 00:32:46,622
I'm fucking proud of mine.

334
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:06,080
Look what I found!

335
00:33:06,616 --> 00:33:10,279
Okay, and before you say anything,
it's cider, it's non-alcoholic...

336
00:33:10,487 --> 00:33:12,648
...and those little kids right there
made it.

337
00:33:12,856 --> 00:33:14,517
-Oh, my gosh, really?
-Yeah.

338
00:33:14,724 --> 00:33:16,658
-I'm gonna go say thank you.
-Okay.

339
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:19,260
They don't speak much English.

340
00:33:21,798 --> 00:33:26,167
This is quite possibly the most
alcoholic cider I've ever tasted.

341
00:33:26,469 --> 00:33:28,096
Come on, it's good for her.
She needs it.

342
00:33:28,304 --> 00:33:29,862
Thank you.

343
00:33:31,408 --> 00:33:32,375
Well, cheers.

344
00:33:37,814 --> 00:33:39,543
Oh, my God, my song! Let's go!

345
00:33:41,251 --> 00:33:42,445
Come!

346
00:33:47,157 --> 00:33:49,557
Come on, Borat.
Let's see what you got.

347
00:34:09,813 --> 00:34:11,337
There they are.

348
00:34:11,548 --> 00:34:12,674
Three o'clock.

349
00:34:13,183 --> 00:34:14,844
-Jesus.
-Right?

350
00:34:15,051 --> 00:34:17,281
It's fucking crazy, huh?
Dead ringer.

351
00:34:17,487 --> 00:34:19,887
Happy fucking birthday, bro.

352
00:34:23,526 --> 00:34:26,859
-Dude, where you going?
-ln for a better look.

353
00:34:52,689 --> 00:34:53,656
Me?

354
00:35:35,164 --> 00:35:36,631
Hi.

355
00:35:37,367 --> 00:35:38,493
Hi.

356
00:35:38,735 --> 00:35:42,364
Would you like to dance with me?

357
00:35:43,907 --> 00:35:45,807
No, thank you. I'm--

358
00:35:46,009 --> 00:35:47,442
I'm not nearly drunk enough.

359
00:35:47,644 --> 00:35:49,134
Come on. I'll show you how.

360
00:35:49,345 --> 00:35:51,472
No, really. It's easy.

361
00:35:53,449 --> 00:35:57,749
No. Thank you, really, but my feet.
I'm tired.

362
00:36:00,823 --> 00:36:02,984
I could have helped you.

363
00:36:04,727 --> 00:36:06,524
Excuse me?

364
00:36:13,636 --> 00:36:14,603
Hey.

365
00:36:15,705 --> 00:36:16,933
Hey.

366
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:19,768
That guy make you some troubles?

367
00:36:20,043 --> 00:36:22,443
No. He's fine.

368
00:36:24,147 --> 00:36:26,377
What he say to you?

369
00:36:27,884 --> 00:36:30,114
Nothing. He just wanted to dance.

370
00:36:31,988 --> 00:36:34,548
He won't bother you anymore.

371
00:36:35,491 --> 00:36:37,686
Oh, he wasn't bothering me.

372
00:36:41,831 --> 00:36:44,493
Here. Take a drink.

373
00:36:51,975 --> 00:36:55,172
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

374
00:37:01,918 --> 00:37:03,715
-Oh, I'm so sorry!
-Don't worry about it.

375
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,888
I'm so, so sorry. I'm such an idiot.

376
00:37:06,089 --> 00:37:07,613
No, it's all right.

377
00:37:08,091 --> 00:37:10,787
-Here, let me get you a drink.
-No, you don't need to.

378
00:37:10,994 --> 00:37:12,325
-No, I insist.
-No, no.

379
00:37:12,528 --> 00:37:14,257
I insist.

380
00:37:23,339 --> 00:37:25,534
Beth! Beth!

381
00:37:25,742 --> 00:37:29,178
Beth! Oh, my God, Roman wants to
take me on a boat ride...

382
00:37:29,379 --> 00:37:31,313
...and he's just so suave
and he's amazing...

383
00:37:31,514 --> 00:37:34,244
...and he doesn't speak English,
but we understand each other.

384
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:39,387
Yeah. Just promise me you won't
go on a boat ride with him, okay?

385
00:37:39,589 --> 00:37:40,886
Why not?

386
00:37:41,124 --> 00:37:42,955
What's the big deal?
You don't fancy him?

387
00:37:43,159 --> 00:37:46,754
Just because he's not "Whitney
approved" or "Beth approved" looking?

388
00:37:46,963 --> 00:37:50,262
No, I'm not saying that at all. I just
want you to stay here where it's safe...

389
00:37:50,466 --> 00:37:52,297
...we're all together,
we don't get separated.

390
00:37:52,502 --> 00:37:54,732
Just promise me
you won't go on a boat ride with him.

391
00:38:02,211 --> 00:38:06,671
Lorna, promise me
you won't go on a boat ride with him.

392
00:38:07,817 --> 00:38:11,548
Beth. It's okay.

393
00:38:11,754 --> 00:38:14,052
-Okay. You promise?
-Okay, okay, okay.

394
00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:15,889
Okay.

395
00:38:17,293 --> 00:38:18,988
Roman.

396
00:38:19,762 --> 00:38:21,730
Okay, two, please.

397
00:38:23,533 --> 00:38:27,162
-Here you go. I'm so sorry about that.
-It's okay.

398
00:38:27,370 --> 00:38:29,736
-Cheers.
-Cheers. Thanks.

399
00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:37,436
So, what brings you
to this corner of the world?

400
00:38:38,314 --> 00:38:41,044
Her. Firestarter.

401
00:38:42,251 --> 00:38:43,741
And you?

402
00:38:46,222 --> 00:38:48,383
I honestly don't know.

403
00:38:51,327 --> 00:38:53,921
I'm sorry, there's probably...

404
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:57,065
...a small army of Slovak boys
all fighting over you.

405
00:38:57,266 --> 00:39:00,895
Why travel all this way
just to talk with an ugly American?

406
00:39:01,104 --> 00:39:03,095
You're not that ugly.

407
00:39:03,306 --> 00:39:04,830
Really?

408
00:39:06,075 --> 00:39:07,633
Well, cheers to that.

409
00:39:07,844 --> 00:39:09,334
Cheers.

410
00:39:10,246 --> 00:39:12,305
Hey, your friend looks like
she's having fun.

411
00:39:13,716 --> 00:39:14,876
Yeah.

412
00:39:15,084 --> 00:39:17,484
I get to listen to them have sex later.

413
00:39:19,188 --> 00:39:21,713
Can we switch?
I'm over at the Dvorzak hotel and...

414
00:39:22,091 --> 00:39:25,754
...it's probably been three centuries
since anybody's had sex over there.

415
00:39:26,963 --> 00:39:29,090
Oh, maybe your table's ready.

416
00:39:30,867 --> 00:39:34,132
That's-- That's a long story.

417
00:39:35,138 --> 00:39:36,969
Well, I'll have to hear about it
another time.

418
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:39,174
I'm gonna take off,
but it's a small village...

419
00:39:39,375 --> 00:39:41,366
-...I'm sure we'll meet again.
-I'm sure we will.

420
00:39:41,577 --> 00:39:43,340
All right. Good night.

421
00:39:43,813 --> 00:39:44,939
Good night, Beth.

422
00:39:46,549 --> 00:39:48,312
Did I tell you my name?

423
00:39:48,618 --> 00:39:50,779
No, no. I heard your friend use it.

424
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:54,815
But I forgot to tell you mine. I'm Stuart.

425
00:39:55,091 --> 00:39:57,059
Good to meet you, Stuart.

426
00:39:57,593 --> 00:39:59,117
Good night.

427
00:40:10,239 --> 00:40:11,831
Lorna!

428
00:40:14,877 --> 00:40:16,367
Lorna!

429
00:40:23,219 --> 00:40:24,550
Lorna.

430
00:40:26,055 --> 00:40:28,046
Excuse me.

431
00:40:33,362 --> 00:40:34,624
Lorna!

432
00:40:37,033 --> 00:40:38,193
Lorna!

433
00:40:39,202 --> 00:40:41,363
Beth, I'm sorry!

434
00:40:42,438 --> 00:40:44,303
You promised.

435
00:40:44,907 --> 00:40:46,704
I know.

436
00:40:46,909 --> 00:40:48,900
I'm sorry!

437
00:41:27,683 --> 00:41:30,049
It's so peaceful.

438
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:33,286
It's so secluded.

439
00:41:37,827 --> 00:41:40,421
Roman, what are you doing?

440
00:41:50,806 --> 00:41:51,773
Come to me.

441
00:42:00,583 --> 00:42:02,551
Close your eyes.

442
00:42:04,921 --> 00:42:06,912
Roman! Roman!

443
00:42:08,758 --> 00:42:11,750
Roman! Roman!

444
00:42:11,961 --> 00:42:14,293
Roman! Roman!

445
00:42:34,116 --> 00:42:36,243
--on a boat
and I have no idea where she is.

446
00:42:36,452 --> 00:42:39,819
-How does she get back from that?
-Beth, come on!

447
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:42,888
Oh, fuck!

448
00:42:44,427 --> 00:42:46,156
Beth!

449
00:42:46,862 --> 00:42:49,194
I cannot leave her alone with this guy.

450
00:42:49,398 --> 00:42:52,834
You know, you just go ahead
and I'll wait for Lorna.

451
00:42:53,035 --> 00:42:55,003
-You go. Yeah.
-Yeah?

452
00:42:55,204 --> 00:42:57,069
-All right. Thank you so much.
-Okay.

453
00:42:57,273 --> 00:42:58,763
-Sure. Yeah.
-Thank you.

454
00:42:59,108 --> 00:43:00,405
Fuck!

455
00:43:00,609 --> 00:43:03,373
-Dude, are you coming?
-Are you okay?

456
00:43:03,579 --> 00:43:05,274
I'm good. I'm good. No, I'm fine.

457
00:43:05,481 --> 00:43:07,312
-Are you all right?
-Dude, I'm fine.

458
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:09,675
Have another cocktail.

459
00:43:14,156 --> 00:43:16,021
All right, good night.

460
00:43:16,726 --> 00:43:18,887
No, Whit. We're going to sleep.

461
00:43:19,095 --> 00:43:20,357
-We are?
-Yeah.

462
00:43:20,563 --> 00:43:23,691
Okay, is he hot,
or is he too, like, eastern bloc?

463
00:43:23,899 --> 00:43:27,096
He's fine. But can we please go
get some rest? Come on.

464
00:43:27,303 --> 00:43:29,100
Oh, you're so sweet. No, I'm fine.

465
00:43:29,305 --> 00:43:31,273
It's okay. I'll take care of her.

466
00:43:31,674 --> 00:43:35,269
I'm sure you will, but not tonight,
all right? Good night, Miroslav.

467
00:43:35,478 --> 00:43:37,503
Good night, Miroslav!

468
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:47,856
I'm sorry. He was just so shady.

469
00:43:48,391 --> 00:43:50,916
Whatever. I wanted to fuck him, but....

470
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:54,787
I know you did. I'll make it up to you.

471
00:43:55,531 --> 00:43:59,092
I guess Mr. Rabbit's gonna have to
go down the hole again tonight.

472
00:44:02,004 --> 00:44:03,528
Do you have a AA?

473
00:44:03,973 --> 00:44:05,702
Mr. Rabbit!

474
00:44:06,208 --> 00:44:08,199
Come here, Rabbit!

475
00:44:13,883 --> 00:44:16,511
Do you remember the first guy
in your high school to get laid?

476
00:44:16,719 --> 00:44:17,947
No, but I remember the last.

477
00:44:18,154 --> 00:44:20,315
Well, I do. This kid Greg.

478
00:44:20,523 --> 00:44:25,222
He came back from summer break,
something about him had changed.

479
00:44:25,428 --> 00:44:28,693
It wasn't anything he said or did, but
something was different. You knew it.

480
00:44:28,898 --> 00:44:32,857
I know what you mean. It's like you can
sense it the way an animal senses it.

481
00:44:33,069 --> 00:44:34,559
Exactly. Like an animal.

482
00:44:34,837 --> 00:44:38,295
Sometimes you meet a guy and there's
something fucking scary about him...

483
00:44:38,507 --> 00:44:41,305
...something that makes you think,
"This guy has killed somebody."

484
00:44:41,510 --> 00:44:44,638
He doesn't have to act tough.
He never has to say it.

485
00:44:44,847 --> 00:44:47,475
But like an animal, you can sense it.

486
00:44:47,950 --> 00:44:51,909
You know that this guy's got the balls
to do what few others can.

487
00:44:52,688 --> 00:44:54,713
And that's you after today, my friend.

488
00:44:54,924 --> 00:44:57,984
People are gonna fucking fear you.
Linda is gonna fucking fear you.

489
00:44:58,194 --> 00:45:02,995
What we do today is gonna pay off
every day for the rest of our lives.

490
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:06,727
-Where's your pager?
-It's back in the room.

491
00:45:06,936 --> 00:45:09,200
-Come on. What the fuck?
-I just figured you had yours.

492
00:45:09,405 --> 00:45:12,203
Is it me? Because it feels like
you're, like, having second thoughts.

493
00:45:12,408 --> 00:45:15,343
You've never really been into this.
I feel like I'm talking you into it.

494
00:45:15,544 --> 00:45:18,104
I don't wanna be doing something
and keep talking about it--

495
00:45:18,314 --> 00:45:22,842
-It's different from taking on an image.
-I am so fucking tired of talking about it.

496
00:45:23,052 --> 00:45:25,350
It's time we fucking do it.

497
00:45:34,797 --> 00:45:36,264
To the next level.

498
00:45:36,465 --> 00:45:38,524
To the next level. No, wait.

499
00:45:38,734 --> 00:45:40,565
Isn't it bad luck to toast with water?

500
00:45:40,769 --> 00:45:44,637
Yeah. Bad luck
for whoever meets us today.

501
00:45:49,345 --> 00:45:51,836
Yeah. Let the games begin.

502
00:46:12,368 --> 00:46:13,926
Hard, hard, hard.

503
00:46:14,136 --> 00:46:15,797
Hey.

504
00:46:16,305 --> 00:46:19,741
-Hey, did she call?
-No. I just checked.

505
00:46:20,309 --> 00:46:23,176
I love that Lorna's the only one of us
that got any action last night.

506
00:46:23,379 --> 00:46:26,746
-Hey, I tried.
-Keep trying.

507
00:46:27,550 --> 00:46:30,075
Yeah, she'd say
this place is majestic.

508
00:46:30,286 --> 00:46:31,253
Sure.

509
00:46:31,453 --> 00:46:33,284
I bet she's making him
breakfast right now.

510
00:46:33,489 --> 00:46:35,013
No, I bet she's in a cum coma.

511
00:46:35,791 --> 00:46:37,486
Thank God.

512
00:46:38,794 --> 00:46:41,092
At least she has something
to write about in her journal.

513
00:50:46,975 --> 00:50:48,465
Please! Please!

514
00:50:48,677 --> 00:50:50,474
Please! Stop!

515
00:50:50,746 --> 00:50:51,872
No!

516
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:54,674
Stop! Please! Please!

517
00:51:01,523 --> 00:51:03,047
Please! Please!

518
00:51:03,258 --> 00:51:05,954
Please, no!

519
00:52:33,982 --> 00:52:35,609
Relax.

520
00:52:39,821 --> 00:52:41,413
Come up here.

521
00:54:14,282 --> 00:54:15,840
Whit?

522
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:26,457
Axelle?

523
00:54:47,382 --> 00:54:48,940
Fuck.

524
00:54:52,287 --> 00:54:53,811
Whit!

525
00:54:55,724 --> 00:54:57,521
Guys!

526
00:55:01,596 --> 00:55:04,121
Axelle! Whit!

527
00:55:48,210 --> 00:55:49,643
Stop. Please help me!

528
00:55:49,845 --> 00:55:51,335
-Go away.
-Please help me!

529
00:55:51,546 --> 00:55:52,979
-Just go away from me!
-No, no, no.

530
00:55:53,415 --> 00:55:55,349
Help me.
These men are chasing me. Please.

531
00:55:55,550 --> 00:55:59,350
I tried to help, but you don't listen.
Go away!

532
00:56:29,384 --> 00:56:31,147
Dollar, bitch!

533
00:56:39,461 --> 00:56:41,156
Stop!

534
00:57:13,295 --> 00:57:14,853
Get in.

535
00:57:15,096 --> 00:57:16,563
Yeah.

536
00:59:50,051 --> 00:59:52,611
The police will be here soon.

537
00:59:53,254 --> 00:59:55,313
They are looking for your friends.

538
00:59:56,057 --> 00:59:57,684
Thank-- Thank you.

539
00:59:58,293 --> 00:59:59,817
More tea?

540
01:00:00,228 --> 01:00:01,695
Please.

541
01:00:07,402 --> 01:00:08,835
Thank you.

542
01:00:23,985 --> 01:00:25,748
So, you and Sasha...

543
01:00:26,221 --> 01:00:29,622
-...are you two...?
-Oh, no. God, no.

544
01:00:29,824 --> 01:00:31,553
He's old enough to be my dad.

545
01:00:33,828 --> 01:00:35,455
What does he do?

546
01:00:35,663 --> 01:00:37,494
He does auctions.

547
01:00:37,966 --> 01:00:40,366
Come. Let's get you some clothes.

548
01:01:09,431 --> 01:01:11,228
No!

549
01:01:11,433 --> 01:01:12,991
No!

550
01:01:15,036 --> 01:01:18,199
Help! No! No!

551
01:01:37,092 --> 01:01:39,185
What did I do wrong?

552
01:01:42,063 --> 01:01:45,521
Please don't hurt me.
Please don't hurt me. I'm sorry.

553
01:01:46,334 --> 01:01:48,131
Please don't hurt me.
Please don't hurt me.

554
01:01:48,336 --> 01:01:50,531
I not hurt you.

555
01:01:50,872 --> 01:01:53,238
Okay. It's okay.

556
01:01:53,441 --> 01:01:54,601
I clean you up.

557
01:01:55,510 --> 01:01:57,944
Please, please help me.

558
01:01:58,813 --> 01:02:00,804
You have a bruise.

559
01:02:03,885 --> 01:02:05,409
What is that?

560
01:02:05,620 --> 01:02:07,281
What are you doing?

561
01:02:09,023 --> 01:02:10,957
I make you pretty.

562
01:02:12,327 --> 01:02:13,760
Pretty for what?

563
01:02:14,696 --> 01:02:16,391
For the client.

564
01:02:16,731 --> 01:02:18,858
Client? What client?

565
01:02:46,794 --> 01:02:48,125
Give me. No.

566
01:02:48,363 --> 01:02:49,330
No.

567
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:53,558
We do...

568
01:02:54,435 --> 01:02:56,369
...nails.

569
01:03:18,860 --> 01:03:19,918
No!

570
01:03:30,038 --> 01:03:32,097
No! No!

571
01:03:38,379 --> 01:03:40,210
Oh, my God.

572
01:03:41,816 --> 01:03:43,215
No!

573
01:03:53,194 --> 01:03:54,923
I'm worried about Whit.

574
01:03:57,298 --> 01:03:59,425
Whitney seems like a tough girl.

575
01:03:59,634 --> 01:04:01,602
She'll be okay.

576
01:04:05,106 --> 01:04:07,233
You have a scratch.

577
01:04:09,244 --> 01:04:10,609
Yeah.

578
01:04:20,255 --> 01:04:23,281
-It's sore.
-I'm sorry.

579
01:04:24,292 --> 01:04:27,193
You have such beautiful skin.

580
01:04:27,395 --> 01:04:28,919
Thank you.

581
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:33,760
Who's that?

582
01:04:34,802 --> 01:04:36,770
Just some friends.

583
01:04:37,438 --> 01:04:39,235
Come. You should lie down.

584
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:41,408
I'll wake you up when the police arrive.

585
01:06:41,929 --> 01:06:43,726
Do you think we're sick?

586
01:06:45,266 --> 01:06:46,426
Fuck, no.

587
01:06:47,168 --> 01:06:49,898
Dude, you look anywhere in the world
where there's no law...

588
01:06:50,571 --> 01:06:53,301
...whether it's fucking Chad
or New Orleans...

589
01:06:53,508 --> 01:06:55,533
...and this is the shit
people are doing, bro.

590
01:06:57,745 --> 01:06:59,679
We're the normal ones.

591
01:07:05,953 --> 01:07:07,614
Any idea what
you're gonna do in there?

592
01:07:10,925 --> 01:07:12,984
You don't even wanna know.

593
01:07:14,695 --> 01:07:16,856
You don't even wanna know.

594
01:10:46,407 --> 01:10:47,965
Jesus.

595
01:11:58,312 --> 01:12:00,007
They're listening. They're listening.

596
01:12:01,515 --> 01:12:05,576
Beth, it's me. It's Stuart.
From the fair.

597
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:08,855
Don't talk loud. Okay?

598
01:12:09,056 --> 01:12:11,820
If they hear us talking like this...

599
01:12:12,159 --> 01:12:13,854
...they're gonna fucking kill us both.

600
01:12:14,662 --> 01:12:15,754
You hear me?

601
01:12:16,297 --> 01:12:18,094
I need to know you're listening.

602
01:12:19,700 --> 01:12:21,292
Okay?

603
01:12:35,950 --> 01:12:38,248
What the fuck are you doing?

604
01:12:38,686 --> 01:12:41,985
What is this place?
Where the fuck are we?

605
01:12:43,023 --> 01:12:44,718
Stuart!

606
01:12:46,427 --> 01:12:50,193
Remember when I said that
I didn't know what I was doing here?

607
01:12:52,133 --> 01:12:53,657
Well...

608
01:12:55,536 --> 01:12:57,697
...this is what I'm doing here.

609
01:13:00,741 --> 01:13:02,208
What is this place?

610
01:13:04,445 --> 01:13:06,208
This place....

611
01:13:07,548 --> 01:13:09,345
People come here....

612
01:13:11,118 --> 01:13:12,813
People come here to kill people.

613
01:13:14,421 --> 01:13:17,720
What? Who kills?

614
01:13:18,659 --> 01:13:20,627
Oh, my God, are they gonna kill us?

615
01:13:21,195 --> 01:13:22,389
Well...

616
01:13:23,864 --> 01:13:25,331
...not...

617
01:13:25,533 --> 01:13:26,761
...us.

618
01:13:28,068 --> 01:13:30,002
Oh, my God.

619
01:13:30,471 --> 01:13:32,666
Oh, my God. Are you gonna kill me?

620
01:13:32,873 --> 01:13:36,036
-You're gonna kill me!
-No. No, no! No, no, no.

621
01:13:36,243 --> 01:13:39,337
No. Jesus, no. No.

622
01:13:39,647 --> 01:13:41,945
Then what the fuck
are you doing here?

623
01:13:42,149 --> 01:13:43,707
What the fuck are you wearing?

624
01:13:43,918 --> 01:13:45,909
Someone brought me here...

625
01:13:46,120 --> 01:13:47,849
...the same as you.

626
01:13:48,789 --> 01:13:50,484
Someone I know.

627
01:13:51,826 --> 01:13:53,259
Look...

628
01:13:53,494 --> 01:13:55,223
...he wanted me to--

629
01:13:55,429 --> 01:13:58,091
To do this with him.

630
01:13:58,699 --> 01:14:00,257
What?

631
01:14:00,701 --> 01:14:01,895
Stuart, please.

632
01:14:02,603 --> 01:14:04,764
Please just let me go.
Help me get out of this chair.

633
01:14:04,972 --> 01:14:09,102
Please. Please help me get out of this
chair. Get me out of this chair, please!

634
01:14:31,665 --> 01:14:35,066
You probably used that face to get
whatever the fuck you wanted.

635
01:14:35,569 --> 01:14:37,537
Fucking skank.

636
01:14:51,018 --> 01:14:53,384
Oh, that's fucking rich.

637
01:14:54,188 --> 01:14:56,520
You should see your fucking face.

638
01:15:00,461 --> 01:15:03,726
-We gotta get out of here.
-We can't.

639
01:15:04,465 --> 01:15:06,763
They think you're gonna kill me?

640
01:15:07,268 --> 01:15:09,463
You're not some monster.

641
01:15:11,205 --> 01:15:13,503
-I'm not that guy.
-No.

642
01:15:13,707 --> 01:15:14,935
No, I know.

643
01:15:15,142 --> 01:15:17,702
-I know you're a good person.
-I'm not that guy.

644
01:15:18,445 --> 01:15:20,538
I know. Of course not.

645
01:15:20,748 --> 01:15:22,511
I'm not that guy.

646
01:15:25,819 --> 01:15:29,118
-Okay. Okay.
-I'm not that guy.

647
01:15:32,026 --> 01:15:33,960
We're gonna get out of here.

648
01:15:40,834 --> 01:15:42,734
I'm not that guy.

649
01:15:47,341 --> 01:15:49,366
I'm not that guy.

650
01:15:52,379 --> 01:15:54,404
I'm not that guy.

651
01:15:55,516 --> 01:15:57,279
There must be a co--

652
01:16:20,107 --> 01:16:22,234
Oh, fuck. Fuck.

653
01:16:38,292 --> 01:16:40,954
Christ! Fuck!

654
01:16:41,762 --> 01:16:43,127
God!

655
01:16:45,232 --> 01:16:46,290
Fuck!

656
01:16:47,568 --> 01:16:50,867
Don't you have family?
Don't you have a wife?

657
01:16:51,739 --> 01:16:53,206
My wife?

658
01:16:53,407 --> 01:16:55,102
My wife?

659
01:16:57,344 --> 01:16:59,175
I'm not allowed to kill my wife.

660
01:17:19,633 --> 01:17:21,726
-Finish?
-Yeah, I'm finished, all right.

661
01:17:21,935 --> 01:17:24,802
Hey, hey! You cannot done.

662
01:17:25,005 --> 01:17:26,700
You go in room, finish.

663
01:17:27,441 --> 01:17:28,908
You know what? I am fucking done.

664
01:17:29,109 --> 01:17:31,577
If you don't like it, you can go in
and finish her yourself.

665
01:17:31,779 --> 01:17:34,373
You cannot leave unless
you complete. It's contract.

666
01:17:34,581 --> 01:17:36,208
I fucking paid!

667
01:17:36,417 --> 01:17:38,214
You have my money
and you can keep it!

668
01:17:38,419 --> 01:17:41,786
I am not going back in that room!
I'm done!

669
01:17:41,989 --> 01:17:43,854
Hey! Hey!

670
01:18:42,616 --> 01:18:44,982
Hello. Special offer.

671
01:18:45,185 --> 01:18:48,586
But she's only available
for the next 20 minutes.

672
01:18:48,822 --> 01:18:50,414
Do you want her?

673
01:18:55,295 --> 01:18:56,922
We'll let you know.

674
01:19:37,504 --> 01:19:39,131
Six-fifty.

675
01:19:58,258 --> 01:19:59,225
Yes?

676
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:04,595
Apologies for interrupting you, but
we have special available right now.

677
01:20:04,798 --> 01:20:06,129
Very good price.

678
01:20:12,005 --> 01:20:13,802
Where's Todd?

679
01:20:26,119 --> 01:20:27,848
Problem with friend.

680
01:20:31,258 --> 01:20:33,556
May I borrow this
for a moment, please?

681
01:20:39,900 --> 01:20:41,424
What do you think?

682
01:20:41,635 --> 01:20:43,330
Should I do it?

683
01:20:43,537 --> 01:20:45,767
I mean, I wouldn't pay
more than a grand for her...

684
01:20:45,973 --> 01:20:47,770
...in this kind of shape, but....

685
01:20:47,975 --> 01:20:49,840
I mean, look at that.

686
01:20:50,043 --> 01:20:51,908
She's not gonna last that long, huh?

687
01:20:53,880 --> 01:20:56,280
You should see
what she did to my friend.

688
01:21:01,622 --> 01:21:03,021
I'll take her.

689
01:21:44,031 --> 01:21:46,295
A souvenir from your friend.

690
01:21:56,443 --> 01:21:58,502
Notice anything different about me?

691
01:22:01,248 --> 01:22:03,307
I bet you fucking do.

692
01:22:04,384 --> 01:22:06,181
Fucking bitch.

693
01:22:10,957 --> 01:22:13,084
Fucking respect me now.

694
01:22:14,961 --> 01:22:17,361
I don't fucking work for you!

695
01:22:18,532 --> 01:22:21,660
I don't work all fucking day
for you to humiliate me.

696
01:22:25,372 --> 01:22:26,532
To tell me I'm shit.

697
01:22:30,877 --> 01:22:32,310
Never fuck me.

698
01:22:33,714 --> 01:22:35,272
Look at you.

699
01:22:35,816 --> 01:22:37,113
What?

700
01:22:37,317 --> 01:22:40,309
What, you got something to say?
Do you? You do, bitch?

701
01:22:40,520 --> 01:22:43,921
Yeah? Oh, good.
Well, it better be fucking good.

702
01:22:44,358 --> 01:22:47,850
-Let's fucking hear it. What?
-I'm not your wife.

703
01:22:48,061 --> 01:22:51,827
I'm not your wife, Stuart.
I'm not your wife.

704
01:22:52,866 --> 01:22:57,530
She doesn't understand you.
She doesn't understand you like I do.

705
01:22:57,738 --> 01:23:00,901
-And I see how you're strong.
-I am strong.

706
01:23:01,108 --> 01:23:03,838
-I am fucking Hercules!
-I see.

707
01:23:04,778 --> 01:23:07,338
I know. I know. I see it. I see it.

708
01:23:07,714 --> 01:23:09,113
I saw it last night.

709
01:23:09,316 --> 01:23:12,877
I was hoping you would kiss me.
I wanted you to kiss me.

710
01:23:14,654 --> 01:23:17,020
I thought about you all night.

711
01:23:24,064 --> 01:23:26,225
Get on the fucking floor.

712
01:23:36,209 --> 01:23:37,608
Are you scared?

713
01:23:40,580 --> 01:23:42,571
You fucking better be.

714
01:23:44,284 --> 01:23:45,842
I am.

715
01:23:46,753 --> 01:23:48,550
I like it.

716
01:24:02,669 --> 01:24:04,227
Look at me.

717
01:24:06,506 --> 01:24:07,871
Bitch.

718
01:24:09,242 --> 01:24:11,972
You fucking whore.

719
01:24:36,970 --> 01:24:38,801
Get in the chair!

720
01:24:39,005 --> 01:24:40,802
Get in the fucking chair!

721
01:24:45,011 --> 01:24:46,478
Fucker!

722
01:25:03,864 --> 01:25:04,831
What's the code?

723
01:25:05,165 --> 01:25:06,996
Fuck you!

724
01:25:11,104 --> 01:25:12,662
What's the fucking code?

725
01:25:16,309 --> 01:25:18,072
-Your birthday.
-What?

726
01:25:18,278 --> 01:25:20,075
What is your birthday?

727
01:25:20,280 --> 01:25:22,214
December 1 2th.

728
01:25:23,884 --> 01:25:26,512
Oh, that is fucking sick.

729
01:25:43,303 --> 01:25:44,736
What the fuck? It's not opening.

730
01:25:46,540 --> 01:25:49,236
It's not fucking opening!

731
01:25:49,442 --> 01:25:51,307
Oh, yes, it is.

732
01:25:52,579 --> 01:25:55,605
Do it! She's right up there
behind you! Kill her!

733
01:25:55,815 --> 01:25:58,613
Motherfucker! Shoot her!

734
01:25:58,952 --> 01:26:01,352
Kill her! Kill her!

735
01:26:04,624 --> 01:26:06,353
Don't shoot!
Be careful, for God's sakes!

736
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:08,551
She'll cut! She'll fucking cut!
Don't shoot!

737
01:26:08,762 --> 01:26:10,093
Fucking she'll cut! She'll cut!

738
01:26:11,331 --> 01:26:12,662
Get Sasha!

739
01:26:12,899 --> 01:26:16,767
You gotta do it! I'm the fucking
customer here! Do it, for fuck's sake.

740
01:26:16,970 --> 01:26:18,801
Jesus fucking Christ. Oh, shit!

741
01:26:19,005 --> 01:26:20,063
-Sasha!
-Get him!

742
01:26:37,924 --> 01:26:39,824
-Wait! I wanna buy my way out of here.
-Wait!

743
01:26:43,196 --> 01:26:46,188
-You can't afford it.
-Don't tell me what I can't afford.

744
01:26:46,399 --> 01:26:50,563
There's nothing I can't afford. I could
buy and sell everyone in this room.

745
01:26:51,705 --> 01:26:53,900
You going to call your parents
for money?

746
01:26:54,107 --> 01:26:56,200
No, motherfucker, it's my money.

747
01:26:56,409 --> 01:26:59,401
Just get me a PDA, a SWlFT number
and a recipient name.

748
01:26:59,613 --> 01:27:02,480
I have accounts in Switzerland,
Luxembourg and the lsle of Man.

749
01:27:02,682 --> 01:27:06,743
Just name your fucking price!
Trust me, I got it.

750
01:27:08,622 --> 01:27:10,146
Okay.

751
01:27:15,695 --> 01:27:16,821
We negotiate.

752
01:27:18,098 --> 01:27:20,931
-This is bullshit!
-This is business.

753
01:27:21,234 --> 01:27:22,292
I'll pay more!

754
01:27:22,736 --> 01:27:24,704
Not with a second mortgage
on your house...

755
01:27:24,904 --> 01:27:26,963
...and your daughter's
private-school tuition.

756
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:29,135
That's why your friend pay.

757
01:27:29,342 --> 01:27:31,207
What's the number?

758
01:27:32,345 --> 01:27:34,745
Money is not the only issue.

759
01:27:34,948 --> 01:27:36,575
We have contract here.

760
01:27:37,384 --> 01:27:38,817
What kind of contract?

761
01:27:40,286 --> 01:27:42,914
Anyone who come to this place...

762
01:27:43,123 --> 01:27:44,750
...cannot leave...

763
01:27:44,958 --> 01:27:46,516
...without killing.

764
01:27:47,460 --> 01:27:50,987
They're still gonna kill you,
you fucking stupid cunt.

765
01:27:52,399 --> 01:27:54,128
What did you say to me?

766
01:27:56,069 --> 01:27:58,867
You're a stupid fucking cu--!

767
01:28:15,755 --> 01:28:17,120
Let him bleed to death.

768
01:28:18,892 --> 01:28:19,916
Misha, no!

769
01:29:00,533 --> 01:29:02,467
Isn't this great?

770
01:29:08,808 --> 01:29:11,072
Hey, get back here!

771
01:29:13,246 --> 01:29:14,440
Wait!

772
01:29:14,647 --> 01:29:16,547
Wait! Wait!

773
01:29:18,318 --> 01:29:19,410
Wait!

774
01:29:20,553 --> 01:29:21,520
Hey!

775
01:29:21,955 --> 01:29:24,549
You fucking shit! Wait!

776
01:34:26,626 --> 01:34:28,526
Bitches!
