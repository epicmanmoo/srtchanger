1
00:03:15,494 --> 00:03:18,520
He say, "Good morning,"
and ask, "How is your hand?"

2
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:22,188
It's-- It's better.

3
00:03:22,434 --> 00:03:23,628
What's left of it.

4
00:03:26,672 --> 00:03:28,105
Sorry.

5
00:03:28,373 --> 00:03:31,137
We would like to speak with you
if you feel well enough.

6
00:03:31,343 --> 00:03:33,470
Yeah, that's all right.

7
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:38,740
-Coffee?
-No, thank you.

8
00:03:40,986 --> 00:03:44,353
Tell us about this place you mention,
in Slovakia.

9
00:03:45,657 --> 00:03:47,488
It's this....

10
00:03:48,393 --> 00:03:50,258
It's some kind of factory...

11
00:03:50,829 --> 00:03:53,297
,,,where these people,
these very rich people,,,

12
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:56,559
,,,they pay to torture and kill kids,

13
00:03:57,102 --> 00:03:58,797
Mostly backpackers,

14
00:04:1,540 --> 00:04:3,872
And they killed two of my friends.

15
00:04:19,892 --> 00:04:21,484
They take you from this hostel...

16
00:04:22,561 --> 00:04:25,189
,,,and they bring you
to this factory and,,,,

17
00:04:26,798 --> 00:04:29,562
I went there looking for Josh,

18
00:04:29,768 --> 00:04:34,205
He was one of my friends
and they took him there and....

19
00:04:36,942 --> 00:04:38,773
And they,,,,

20
00:04:38,977 --> 00:04:39,944
They killed him,

21
00:04:43,615 --> 00:04:45,310
It was horrible.

22
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:58,824
He ask how you survive.

23
00:05:3,335 --> 00:05:4,302
I....

24
00:05:13,345 --> 00:05:15,245
I escaped.

25
00:05:26,158 --> 00:05:28,251
Who organize this place?

26
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:33,830
I don't know.
It's some kind of hunting club. They....

27
00:05:34,366 --> 00:05:37,426
They all have the same tattoo.

28
00:05:37,636 --> 00:05:38,728
It's a dog,

29
00:05:38,937 --> 00:05:40,461
It's a bloodhound dog,

30
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,745
Strange that you mention this tattoo.

31
00:05:59,910 --> 00:05:60,149
Why?

32
00:06:8,800 --> 00:06:13,703
Because someone was found dead
in a train station bathroom in Vienna...

33
00:06:13,905 --> 00:06:16,305
...with this same bloodhound tattoo
you describe.

34
00:06:23,682 --> 00:06:27,812
Security tapes from this station
show him entering from a platform...

35
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:32,150
...where a train arrive earlier that day
from Slovakia.

36
00:06:32,357 --> 00:06:34,848
It came through
the same station in Vienna.

37
00:06:39,364 --> 00:06:41,332
You were on that tape.

38
00:06:47,172 --> 00:06:50,972
Did his tattoo look something like this?

39
00:06:51,476 --> 00:06:53,103
What the fuck's going on?

40
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:55,507
Help! Somebody help me!

41
00:07:8,260 --> 00:07:9,386
Jesus.

42
00:07:20,939 --> 00:07:22,497
You hungry?

43
00:07:22,974 --> 00:07:24,999
It's 3:1 5 in the morning.

44
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:27,906
I have to take these with food.
I wanna know if you want anything.

45
00:07:28,146 --> 00:07:31,470
Yeah, I want you to talk to someone.

46
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,143
When are you gonna tell
Josh's mother what happened?

47
00:07:34,353 --> 00:07:35,650
I'm not.

48
00:07:37,989 --> 00:07:39,820
She still thinks her son's in Europe.

49
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,289
What the fuck
am I supposed to tell her?

50
00:07:42,494 --> 00:07:45,520
-She'll go straight to the police.
-Yeah, exactly. Someone should.

51
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:49,861
No, no one should. You don't get it.
These people are tied into everyone.

52
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,501
Somebody starts asking questions...

53
00:07:51,703 --> 00:07:53,568
...they're gonna come after me
and find me.

54
00:07:53,972 --> 00:07:57,806
At my grandmother's house? I've
been coming here since I was a kid.

55
00:07:58,900 --> 00:07:60,807
I can barely find the place.
I had to ask my sister for directions.

56
00:08:1,120 --> 00:08:3,370
-You told your sister we were here?
-Yeah. So?

57
00:08:3,248 --> 00:08:5,739
-Well, who else knows?
-No one!

58
00:08:5,951 --> 00:08:7,418
Jesus.

59
00:08:8,553 --> 00:08:11,440
I'm doing this for your protection too.
You know that, right?

60
00:08:11,256 --> 00:08:13,588
Oh, Paxton....

61
00:08:15,927 --> 00:08:16,916
Look.

62
00:08:17,529 --> 00:08:19,929
I took you back because I felt bad.

63
00:08:20,465 --> 00:08:22,865
But you're going crazy.

64
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,526
You wake up every night screaming,
and I can't sleep.

65
00:08:26,738 --> 00:08:28,330
Well, that won't
be a problem anymore.

66
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,167
Paxton, that's not what l--

67
00:08:31,143 --> 00:08:33,509
Oh, fuck.

68
00:09:3,842 --> 00:09:5,503
Morning!

69
00:09:24,529 --> 00:09:26,360
Paxton?

70
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:36,768
Hey.

71
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:57,521
Lorna?

72
00:10:57,822 --> 00:10:59,380
Lorna?

73
00:11:1,693 --> 00:11:5,940
Sorry. I was trying to be
in the moment.

74
00:11:5,297 --> 00:11:7,265
Absorb.

75
00:11:12,637 --> 00:11:15,731
Do you think she ever saw a cock
before this class?

76
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:18,236
If she did, it was in a Botticelli.

77
00:11:18,443 --> 00:11:19,705
Oh, my God.

78
00:11:19,911 --> 00:11:23,779
If I hear her talk about how emotional
the Botticelllis are one more time...

79
00:11:23,982 --> 00:11:26,746
...I swear to God,
I'm gonna choke the bitch to death.

80
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:36,991
Until Tuesday.

81
00:11:37,195 --> 00:11:38,594
Are you all packed for Prague?

82
00:11:38,797 --> 00:11:41,197
-Jeans. No heels.
-Awesome.

83
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:43,890
I can't do it on the cobblestone.
I don't know how you do it.

84
00:11:44,102 --> 00:11:46,195
I can teach you if you bring heels.

85
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,750
Axelle.

86
00:12:1,720 --> 00:12:4,951
Hands on your pencils, boys.

87
00:12:19,638 --> 00:12:21,970
-Would he ever?
-Excuse me, girls.

88
00:12:22,173 --> 00:12:23,470
-Excuse me. Hi.
-Hi.

89
00:12:23,675 --> 00:12:26,371
-May I see?
-Oh, they're just rough.

90
00:12:26,578 --> 00:12:29,103
Show her. Don't be shy.

91
00:12:32,717 --> 00:12:34,140
That's the one of you.

92
00:12:34,252 --> 00:12:37,619
-Oh, wow, that's beautiful.
-Thanks.

93
00:12:37,822 --> 00:12:39,312
How much would you want for it?

94
00:12:39,524 --> 00:12:41,458
I wouldn't sell them.
You can have this one.

95
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,150
-Really?
-Yeah.

96
00:12:43,361 --> 00:12:46,626
-Oh, my God, thank you so much.
-You're welcome.

97
00:12:46,831 --> 00:12:49,260
Can I buy you a drink or something?

98
00:12:49,234 --> 00:12:52,670
Oh, I'm actually late. We're
catching a train to Prague, but....

99
00:12:52,871 --> 00:12:55,203
-I don't know. Maybe some other time.
-Okay.

100
00:12:55,407 --> 00:12:57,238
-Yeah! Okay.
-Okay.

101
00:12:57,442 --> 00:12:60,843
-I'll see you.
-All right. Bye. Thanks.

102
00:13:9,187 --> 00:13:11,519
No, Dad. It's Prague.
We're gonna be fine.

103
00:13:11,723 --> 00:13:13,588
It's not the Ukraine.

104
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:17,494
No.

105
00:13:19,464 --> 00:13:21,796
No, Dad,
do not book the Four Seasons.

106
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,433
Book it, bitch. Book it. Please!

107
00:13:23,635 --> 00:13:27,594
Because, Dad, no college students
are staying at the Four Seasons.

108
00:13:27,806 --> 00:13:32,402
And, you know, it's for old people.
So thank you, but please don't.

109
00:13:33,178 --> 00:13:34,543
What?

110
00:13:37,682 --> 00:13:40,820
Yeah. Yes, we have chaperones.

111
00:13:40,285 --> 00:13:42,116
Okay, love you. Bye.

112
00:13:42,587 --> 00:13:45,249
Jesus, I hate that he calls
every fucking five minutes.

113
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:48,620
-All right, let's go.
-Hold on. We gotta wait for someone.

114
00:13:49,227 --> 00:13:50,558
Who?

115
00:13:53,665 --> 00:13:54,689
-Yeah.
-No.

116
00:13:54,899 --> 00:13:55,957
-Yeah.
-No.

117
00:13:56,167 --> 00:13:58,795
She cornered me in the apartment.
She's homesick, crying.

118
00:13:59,300 --> 00:13:60,630
I felt bad. What am I supposed to say?

119
00:13:60,839 --> 00:14:4,360
She's homesick for Baltimore?
We're in Rome, for fuck's sake.

120
00:14:4,242 --> 00:14:5,869
She's not that bad.

121
00:14:21,993 --> 00:14:24,860
Wow, is that a new journal
you got there?

122
00:14:24,963 --> 00:14:27,900
Yeah. It's a travel journal.

123
00:14:27,298 --> 00:14:28,822
For emotional callbacks.

124
00:14:29,801 --> 00:14:30,995
Of course.

125
00:14:32,504 --> 00:14:34,438
Lorna, we're gonna grab a drink.
You wanna go?

126
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,605
I'm okay. Thank you.

127
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:40,774
All right.
Well, we'll see you in a little bit. Okay.

128
00:14:42,347 --> 00:14:43,507
Knock yourself out, buddy.

129
00:14:43,782 --> 00:14:45,306
See you later.

130
00:14:57,228 --> 00:14:60,129
Excuse you. Asshole.

131
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:13,471
She's like a 20-year-old grandmother.

132
00:15:13,678 --> 00:15:15,771
Whatever. She'll watch our stuff.
She's happy there.

133
00:15:16,147 --> 00:15:18,274
That's what she likes to do.

134
00:15:18,483 --> 00:15:19,882
Oh, we didn't order these.

135
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,881
They're from girl.

136
00:15:25,156 --> 00:15:27,215
Whoa, your girlfriend's stalking us.

137
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:30,522
Hey. What are you doing?

138
00:15:30,995 --> 00:15:33,156
You inspired me to take a trip.

139
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:44,100
Watch this.

140
00:15:46,945 --> 00:15:48,936
You've got to be kidding me.

141
00:15:49,314 --> 00:15:50,576
Hello. What's your name?

142
00:15:58,623 --> 00:16:2,252
Do you know where we could score,
like, party favors?

143
00:16:2,894 --> 00:16:3,986
What do you need?

144
00:16:4,195 --> 00:16:7,358
I don't know.
Like, bud and ecstasy and, like....

145
00:16:8,867 --> 00:16:10,198
PCP?

146
00:16:10,401 --> 00:16:12,699
Ice? Peyote? Crank?

147
00:16:12,904 --> 00:16:15,650
Okay, okay, bud and X are good.

148
00:16:17,475 --> 00:16:18,840
Sure.

149
00:16:19,911 --> 00:16:23,438
We go back to my car. I got some.

150
00:16:23,815 --> 00:16:25,430
Yeah?

151
00:16:26,384 --> 00:16:28,614
-Yeah?
-Okay.

152
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:41,593
Fuck. You know what?

153
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:46,131
I'm trying but I can't find them.
Just hang on, yeah?

154
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,908
-You want drink?
-No, I'm fine.

155
00:17:4,550 --> 00:17:5,147
Hey, you know what?

156
00:17:5,356 --> 00:17:8,484
It's okay because we can just get
it at the club when we go to Prague.

157
00:17:8,693 --> 00:17:10,627
No, stay.

158
00:17:12,363 --> 00:17:14,888
I find them. Okay?

159
00:17:20,338 --> 00:17:22,329
You smell nice.

160
00:17:24,609 --> 00:17:27,237
-Whit, we gotta go. Lorna's waiting.
-Yeah, we have our friend.

161
00:17:27,445 --> 00:17:28,776
-You have friend?
-Yeah.

162
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:32,313
One, two, three, perfetto, Otherwise,
we have to take turns, huh?

163
00:17:35,887 --> 00:17:37,650
You know, we're gonna go,
so never mind.

164
00:17:37,855 --> 00:17:42,155
Where you go? I knew you were
a tease, you fucking cunt.

165
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,657
What the fuck did you call me?

166
00:17:43,861 --> 00:17:46,659
I called you
stupid fucking American cunt!

167
00:17:46,864 --> 00:17:48,240
-Fuck you!
-You know what?

168
00:17:48,232 --> 00:17:51,724
The train to fucking Prague
is long, you bitch.

169
00:17:51,936 --> 00:17:53,631
We'll come see you.

170
00:17:54,272 --> 00:17:55,705
Are you fucking insane?

171
00:17:55,907 --> 00:17:57,272
What? I fucking hate that word.

172
00:17:57,475 --> 00:17:59,807
"Oh, you stupid American cunt."
I fucking lost my temper.

173
00:17:60,110 --> 00:18:2,275
Okay, but it's not like
we're on campus and you can...

174
00:18:2,480 --> 00:18:5,740
...call the dean
and file a report or something.

175
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,283
Oh, my God. Lorna, what happened?

176
00:18:12,724 --> 00:18:14,658
Some guy took my iPod.

177
00:18:14,859 --> 00:18:16,530
What?

178
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:19,580
Is there, like, a police officer
on the train or something?

179
00:18:19,564 --> 00:18:21,759
-Yeah. I'll go check.
-Okay.

180
00:18:23,601 --> 00:18:24,863
It had everything.

181
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:28,571
That's awful. I'm so sorry.

182
00:18:30,241 --> 00:18:31,936
I'm sorry.

183
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:37,538
Here you go.

184
00:18:51,929 --> 00:18:53,487
It's those fucking guys.

185
00:18:53,698 --> 00:18:56,792
The fucking guys, the ltalian guys
from the room down the hall.

186
00:18:57,535 --> 00:18:59,696
-What do we do?
-Just be quiet.

187
00:19:8,446 --> 00:19:9,470
-Hi.
-Hi.

188
00:19:9,680 --> 00:19:12,120
Excuse me.
Did one of you girls lose this?

189
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:14,215
Oh, my God!

190
00:19:14,886 --> 00:19:16,649
How did you know this was mine?

191
00:19:16,854 --> 00:19:20,510
I saw some guy run out of your room.
He tried to take my bag.

192
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:22,858
I fought him off
and this felled out of his pocket.

193
00:19:23,394 --> 00:19:25,794
I'm a little worried he might
come back looking for me.

194
00:19:25,997 --> 00:19:28,465
Well, do you wanna come in here
and hang out with us?

195
00:19:28,699 --> 00:19:30,530
-Really?
-Yeah, we have an extra seat.

196
00:19:30,735 --> 00:19:31,861
-Yeah, come in.
-Totally.

197
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:33,230
Thank you.

198
00:19:36,207 --> 00:19:37,834
I think...

199
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:39,907
...we all need a little of this.

200
00:19:40,878 --> 00:19:42,311
Oh, awesome.

201
00:19:43,714 --> 00:19:45,875
Oh, no, thanks. I don't drink.

202
00:19:46,417 --> 00:19:48,900
Thank you.

203
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:50,719
As my father always says:

204
00:19:50,955 --> 00:19:53,150
"Nazdrovia." To your health.

205
00:20:6,604 --> 00:20:9,334
So are you going to Prague
for the football match?

206
00:20:9,540 --> 00:20:11,337
I kind of wanna go home.

207
00:20:11,542 --> 00:20:16,200
Oh, I don't blame you. I got
robbed twice on the overnight train.

208
00:20:16,214 --> 00:20:18,790
There are so few safe places
left in Europe.

209
00:20:18,716 --> 00:20:19,978
So where are you going?

210
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:22,643
On a little spa vacation.

211
00:20:23,187 --> 00:20:24,154
Where?

212
00:20:24,689 --> 00:20:25,917
Slovakia.

213
00:20:26,124 --> 00:20:28,354
Wait, wasn't there, like,
some war in Slovakia?

214
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:32,691
There hasn't been war in Slovakia
for 50 years.

215
00:20:32,897 --> 00:20:34,125
That's Bosnia, darling.

216
00:20:34,332 --> 00:20:36,630
-Oh, like you knew.
-I did so.

217
00:20:36,834 --> 00:20:38,358
What are the spas like there?

218
00:20:38,569 --> 00:20:42,198
They're the best natural hot springs
in the world.

219
00:20:42,406 --> 00:20:46,467
I go twice a year. It's great to get away
from the ltalian guys.

220
00:20:46,677 --> 00:20:48,800
They get to be a bit much.

221
00:20:49,213 --> 00:20:51,204
Wow, hot springs?

222
00:20:51,415 --> 00:20:54,782
That sounds so therapeutic.
I wanna go.

223
00:20:54,986 --> 00:20:58,513
It's very easy. You just have to
switch trains in Prague.

224
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:1,920
It could be nice.

225
00:21:2,226 --> 00:21:6,686
You know? I had enough gross guys
for one weekend.

226
00:21:7,832 --> 00:21:9,697
Okay, we'll go.

227
00:21:14,272 --> 00:21:15,864
Do you know of a good place to stay?

228
00:21:17,241 --> 00:21:22,235
-Smart move with the shoes.
-What? It's so easy. You have to try it.

229
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:52,839
Hi. Can I help you?

230
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,535
-I need a room for my friends, please.
-Yeah, cool.

231
00:21:55,746 --> 00:21:57,737
Your passports, please.

232
00:22:1,652 --> 00:22:3,745
American. Good.

233
00:22:3,955 --> 00:22:6,685
Yeah, cool. It's 1 0 Euros for night.

234
00:22:8,392 --> 00:22:9,950
No. I got this one.

235
00:22:10,161 --> 00:22:11,423
No. It's on me.

236
00:22:11,629 --> 00:22:13,893
-Thank you.
-Money.

237
00:22:14,265 --> 00:22:15,892
Thanks.

238
00:22:18,269 --> 00:22:19,634
Here are your keys.

239
00:22:21,205 --> 00:22:24,800
And this is a notice for
the harvest fair tonight, girls.

240
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,842
Will be sexy good times. Come on.

241
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:30,878
It's Dozinky, I know that.
They have it every year.

242
00:22:31,282 --> 00:22:34,774
-Yeah.
-Lots of music, dancing, costumes.

243
00:22:34,986 --> 00:22:37,450
Oh, my gosh! Could we go?

244
00:22:38,723 --> 00:22:41,214
-lt sounds kind of gay.
-Excuse me.

245
00:22:47,565 --> 00:22:49,897
Oh, we are so going to
the harvest festival.

246
00:22:50,101 --> 00:22:53,434
-Come on. This way.
-Thank you.

247
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,939
You're welcome.

248
00:22:58,843 --> 00:23:1,710
Do you think they have any frescoes
in the room?

249
00:23:23,501 --> 00:23:26,436
Wow, this room feels so timeless.

250
00:23:26,637 --> 00:23:28,537
Are you kidding right now?

251
00:23:31,742 --> 00:23:32,766
Oh, my God!

252
00:23:34,111 --> 00:23:35,874
Sexy.

253
00:23:37,214 --> 00:23:38,613
Come here,

254
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,770
Yes! Yes!

255
00:25:51,115 --> 00:25:52,742
Yeah!

256
00:25:53,551 --> 00:25:55,178
That's what I'm talking about, huh?

257
00:26:17,775 --> 00:26:19,470
Todd, what's up?

258
00:26:20,845 --> 00:26:23,837
Yeah, nothing.
We're just finishing up breakfast.

259
00:26:26,383 --> 00:26:27,748
Really?

260
00:26:31,322 --> 00:26:33,222
Wow, I didn't think--

261
00:26:34,859 --> 00:26:37,259
Jesus. You sure?

262
00:26:38,362 --> 00:26:43,425
Yeah, yeah, okay. I can go right now.
I'll tell her I have to meet a client.

263
00:26:44,201 --> 00:26:45,793
Okay.

264
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:47,897
See you.

265
00:26:57,147 --> 00:26:60,275
No respect for me,
No respect for mother earth,

266
00:26:60,484 --> 00:27:3,351
Well, don't you have
anything to say for yourself?

267
00:27:5,155 --> 00:27:7,623
Well, that's just fine,
We can all ride home in silence,

268
00:27:15,132 --> 00:27:18,863
Gosh! This village is so enchanting.

269
00:27:19,336 --> 00:27:21,702
Lorna, are you having a
"journal-gasm" right now?

270
00:27:21,906 --> 00:27:23,931
Actually, yes. Multiple ones.

271
00:27:24,141 --> 00:27:27,167
I get to write about
how beautiful this village is...

272
00:27:27,378 --> 00:27:29,869
...and I get to write about
what a raving bitch you are.

273
00:27:32,483 --> 00:27:34,451
She comes back swinging!

274
00:27:34,652 --> 00:27:37,348
-Well-played.
-Thank you.

275
00:27:40,624 --> 00:27:41,591
Dollar!

276
00:27:42,326 --> 00:27:43,384
Dollar!

277
00:27:43,827 --> 00:27:45,590
Do you guys have a dollar?

278
00:27:45,796 --> 00:27:48,196
-I got it.
-Oh, no, no, no.

279
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:51,334
No, no, no. I got it. I got it.
Let me.

280
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:57,874
I have Smints.

281
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:1,539
Would you like a Smint?

282
00:28:14,124 --> 00:28:15,819
Bitches!

283
00:28:22,466 --> 00:28:24,593
Welcome to Slovakia.

284
00:28:32,643 --> 00:28:36,170
You both have corner suites
with views of the river.

285
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:38,439
Here are your pagers.

286
00:28:38,649 --> 00:28:41,413
Perfect. Thank you.

287
00:28:43,587 --> 00:28:46,317
-You ready to do this?
-Yeah, I'm ready.

288
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:48,490
Really?

289
00:28:48,692 --> 00:28:51,160
Because you look like
your dog just died.

290
00:28:51,362 --> 00:28:54,580
I'm just jet-lagged, man.
I'll take a shower and I'll feel better.

291
00:28:54,264 --> 00:28:56,494
-All right.
-Thanks.

292
00:28:60,304 --> 00:29:2,602
Oh, my God!

293
00:29:60,230 --> 00:30:1,595
Hey, guys!

294
00:30:2,660 --> 00:30:3,900
Yes?

295
00:30:3,567 --> 00:30:5,194
For the apartment.

296
00:30:5,502 --> 00:30:7,436
Awesome, dude.

297
00:30:7,638 --> 00:30:10,334
Those swords are like 1 000 Euros.

298
00:30:10,541 --> 00:30:12,668
Trust me, she can afford it.

299
00:30:13,644 --> 00:30:16,545
Does she get, like,
a really big allowance?

300
00:30:16,847 --> 00:30:19,213
No, it's more like an inheritance.

301
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:23,344
Her mom died when she was 1 2 and,
like, left her everything.

302
00:30:23,554 --> 00:30:25,419
And so she keeps her dad
on an allowance.

303
00:30:26,757 --> 00:30:28,349
-Really?
-Yeah.

304
00:30:29,526 --> 00:30:32,757
She could pretty much buy Slovakia
if she wanted to.

305
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:37,659
Yeah. It's pretty rad.

306
00:31:4,728 --> 00:31:6,286
Yeah!

307
00:31:7,431 --> 00:31:9,296
Badass.

308
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,560
Let me see this motherfucker.

309
00:31:17,641 --> 00:31:19,336
You're up, bro.

310
00:31:22,913 --> 00:31:25,848
I think I'm gonna pass on the tattoo.

311
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:27,482
Come on, man, sit down.

312
00:31:27,684 --> 00:31:31,510
A tattoo's not really me.
It's not my style.

313
00:31:31,255 --> 00:31:35,550
I didn't know and I don't like needles.
I don't like needles very much.

314
00:31:35,259 --> 00:31:37,750
Dude, what are you doing? Sit down.

315
00:31:37,961 --> 00:31:40,862
Here's the problem. Linda. What
is she gonna say when she sees this?

316
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:44,465
My wife is not gonna
really understand.

317
00:31:44,668 --> 00:31:47,136
Is there some other option?

318
00:31:47,905 --> 00:31:50,499
Everyone must get tattooed.
Part of contract.

319
00:31:50,874 --> 00:31:51,841
Yeah.

320
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:53,269
Let's do it. Come on, man.

321
00:31:53,477 --> 00:31:55,502
Why don't you sit down?
These guys aren't playing.

322
00:31:55,813 --> 00:31:58,373
A tattoo is
a little difficult to explain, Todd.

323
00:31:58,582 --> 00:31:60,573
Didn't seem like you had
any problem explaining...

324
00:31:60,784 --> 00:32:3,116
...the gonorrhea you brought back
from Thailand.

325
00:32:3,320 --> 00:32:5,811
Can't believe you're bringing up
the gonorrhea. Every time--

326
00:32:6,824 --> 00:32:8,189
Is there any problem here?

327
00:32:8,392 --> 00:32:11,850
No, no. I just didn't know
that this was part of it.

328
00:32:15,465 --> 00:32:16,864
Stuart.

329
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:21,868
This is not like going to a whorehouse.
You can't just back out.

330
00:32:27,744 --> 00:32:30,542
Get in the fucking chair.

331
00:32:37,221 --> 00:32:38,813
Yeah.

332
00:32:40,891 --> 00:32:43,485
Come on, man. Look at this.

333
00:32:43,927 --> 00:32:46,122
I'm fucking proud of mine.

334
00:33:3,180 --> 00:33:5,580
Look what I found!

335
00:33:6,116 --> 00:33:9,779
Okay, and before you say anything,
it's cider, it's non-alcoholic...

336
00:33:9,987 --> 00:33:12,148
...and those little kids right there
made it.

337
00:33:12,356 --> 00:33:14,170
-Oh, my gosh, really?
-Yeah.

338
00:33:14,224 --> 00:33:16,158
-I'm gonna go say thank you.
-Okay.

339
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:18,760
They don't speak much English.

340
00:33:21,298 --> 00:33:25,667
This is quite possibly the most
alcoholic cider I've ever tasted.

341
00:33:25,969 --> 00:33:27,596
Come on, it's good for her.
She needs it.

342
00:33:27,804 --> 00:33:29,362
Thank you.

343
00:33:30,908 --> 00:33:31,875
Well, cheers.

344
00:33:37,314 --> 00:33:39,430
Oh, my God, my song! Let's go!

345
00:33:40,751 --> 00:33:41,945
Come!

346
00:33:46,657 --> 00:33:49,570
Come on, Borat.
Let's see what you got.

347
00:34:9,313 --> 00:34:10,837
There they are.

348
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,174
Three o'clock.

349
00:34:12,683 --> 00:34:14,344
-Jesus.
-Right?

350
00:34:14,551 --> 00:34:16,781
It's fucking crazy, huh?
Dead ringer.

351
00:34:16,987 --> 00:34:19,387
Happy fucking birthday, bro.

352
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:26,359
-Dude, where you going?
-ln for a better look.

353
00:34:52,189 --> 00:34:53,156
Me?

354
00:35:34,664 --> 00:35:36,131
Hi.

355
00:35:36,867 --> 00:35:37,993
Hi.

356
00:35:38,235 --> 00:35:41,864
Would you like to dance with me?

357
00:35:43,407 --> 00:35:45,307
No, thank you. I'm--

358
00:35:45,509 --> 00:35:46,942
I'm not nearly drunk enough.

359
00:35:47,144 --> 00:35:48,634
Come on. I'll show you how.

360
00:35:48,845 --> 00:35:50,972
No, really. It's easy.

361
00:35:52,949 --> 00:35:57,249
No. Thank you, really, but my feet.
I'm tired.

362
00:35:60,323 --> 00:36:2,484
I could have helped you.

363
00:36:4,227 --> 00:36:6,240
Excuse me?

364
00:36:13,136 --> 00:36:14,103
Hey.

365
00:36:15,205 --> 00:36:16,433
Hey.

366
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,268
That guy make you some troubles?

367
00:36:19,543 --> 00:36:21,943
No. He's fine.

368
00:36:23,647 --> 00:36:25,877
What he say to you?

369
00:36:27,384 --> 00:36:29,614
Nothing. He just wanted to dance.

370
00:36:31,488 --> 00:36:34,480
He won't bother you anymore.

371
00:36:34,991 --> 00:36:37,186
Oh, he wasn't bothering me.

372
00:36:41,331 --> 00:36:43,993
Here. Take a drink.

373
00:36:51,475 --> 00:36:54,672
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

374
00:37:1,418 --> 00:37:3,215
-Oh, I'm so sorry!
-Don't worry about it.

375
00:37:3,420 --> 00:37:5,388
I'm so, so sorry. I'm such an idiot.

376
00:37:5,589 --> 00:37:7,113
No, it's all right.

377
00:37:7,591 --> 00:37:10,287
-Here, let me get you a drink.
-No, you don't need to.

378
00:37:10,494 --> 00:37:11,825
-No, I insist.
-No, no.

379
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,757
I insist.

380
00:37:22,839 --> 00:37:25,340
Beth! Beth!

381
00:37:25,242 --> 00:37:28,678
Beth! Oh, my God, Roman wants to
take me on a boat ride...

382
00:37:28,879 --> 00:37:30,813
...and he's just so suave
and he's amazing...

383
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:33,744
...and he doesn't speak English,
but we understand each other.

384
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:38,887
Yeah. Just promise me you won't
go on a boat ride with him, okay?

385
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:40,386
Why not?

386
00:37:40,624 --> 00:37:42,455
What's the big deal?
You don't fancy him?

387
00:37:42,659 --> 00:37:46,254
Just because he's not "Whitney
approved" or "Beth approved" looking?

388
00:37:46,463 --> 00:37:49,762
No, I'm not saying that at all. I just
want you to stay here where it's safe...

389
00:37:49,966 --> 00:37:51,797
...we're all together,
we don't get separated.

390
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,232
Just promise me
you won't go on a boat ride with him.

391
00:38:1,711 --> 00:38:6,171
Lorna, promise me
you won't go on a boat ride with him.

392
00:38:7,317 --> 00:38:11,480
Beth. It's okay.

393
00:38:11,254 --> 00:38:13,552
-Okay. You promise?
-Okay, okay, okay.

394
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:15,389
Okay.

395
00:38:16,793 --> 00:38:18,488
Roman.

396
00:38:19,262 --> 00:38:21,230
Okay, two, please.

397
00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:26,662
-Here you go. I'm so sorry about that.
-It's okay.

398
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:29,236
-Cheers.
-Cheers. Thanks.

399
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:36,936
So, what brings you
to this corner of the world?

400
00:38:37,814 --> 00:38:40,544
Her. Firestarter.

401
00:38:41,751 --> 00:38:43,241
And you?

402
00:38:45,722 --> 00:38:47,883
I honestly don't know.

403
00:38:50,827 --> 00:38:53,421
I'm sorry, there's probably...

404
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:56,565
...a small army of Slovak boys
all fighting over you.

405
00:38:56,766 --> 00:38:60,395
Why travel all this way
just to talk with an ugly American?

406
00:38:60,604 --> 00:39:2,595
You're not that ugly.

407
00:39:2,806 --> 00:39:4,330
Really?

408
00:39:5,575 --> 00:39:7,133
Well, cheers to that.

409
00:39:7,344 --> 00:39:8,834
Cheers.

410
00:39:9,746 --> 00:39:11,805
Hey, your friend looks like
she's having fun.

411
00:39:13,216 --> 00:39:14,376
Yeah.

412
00:39:14,584 --> 00:39:16,984
I get to listen to them have sex later.

413
00:39:18,688 --> 00:39:21,213
Can we switch?
I'm over at the Dvorzak hotel and...

414
00:39:21,591 --> 00:39:25,254
...it's probably been three centuries
since anybody's had sex over there.

415
00:39:26,463 --> 00:39:28,590
Oh, maybe your table's ready.

416
00:39:30,367 --> 00:39:33,632
That's-- That's a long story.

417
00:39:34,638 --> 00:39:36,469
Well, I'll have to hear about it
another time.

418
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:38,674
I'm gonna take off,
but it's a small village...

419
00:39:38,875 --> 00:39:40,866
-...I'm sure we'll meet again.
-I'm sure we will.

420
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:42,840
All right. Good night.

421
00:39:43,313 --> 00:39:44,439
Good night, Beth.

422
00:39:46,490 --> 00:39:47,812
Did I tell you my name?

423
00:39:48,118 --> 00:39:50,279
No, no. I heard your friend use it.

424
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:54,315
But I forgot to tell you mine. I'm Stuart.

425
00:39:54,591 --> 00:39:56,559
Good to meet you, Stuart.

426
00:39:57,930 --> 00:39:58,617
Good night.

427
00:40:9,739 --> 00:40:11,331
Lorna!

428
00:40:14,377 --> 00:40:15,867
Lorna!

429
00:40:22,719 --> 00:40:24,500
Lorna.

430
00:40:25,555 --> 00:40:27,546
Excuse me.

431
00:40:32,862 --> 00:40:34,124
Lorna!

432
00:40:36,533 --> 00:40:37,693
Lorna!

433
00:40:38,702 --> 00:40:40,863
Beth, I'm sorry!

434
00:40:41,938 --> 00:40:43,803
You promised.

435
00:40:44,407 --> 00:40:46,204
I know.

436
00:40:46,409 --> 00:40:48,400
I'm sorry!

437
00:41:27,183 --> 00:41:29,549
It's so peaceful.

438
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:32,786
It's so secluded.

439
00:41:37,327 --> 00:41:39,921
Roman, what are you doing?

440
00:41:50,306 --> 00:41:51,273
Come to me.

441
00:41:60,830 --> 00:42:2,510
Close your eyes.

442
00:42:4,421 --> 00:42:6,412
Roman! Roman!

443
00:42:8,258 --> 00:42:11,250
Roman! Roman!

444
00:42:11,461 --> 00:42:13,793
Roman! Roman!

445
00:42:33,616 --> 00:42:35,743
--on a boat
and I have no idea where she is.

446
00:42:35,952 --> 00:42:39,319
-How does she get back from that?
-Beth, come on!

447
00:42:40,523 --> 00:42:42,388
Oh, fuck!

448
00:42:43,927 --> 00:42:45,656
Beth!

449
00:42:46,362 --> 00:42:48,694
I cannot leave her alone with this guy.

450
00:42:48,898 --> 00:42:52,334
You know, you just go ahead
and I'll wait for Lorna.

451
00:42:52,535 --> 00:42:54,503
-You go. Yeah.
-Yeah?

452
00:42:54,704 --> 00:42:56,569
-All right. Thank you so much.
-Okay.

453
00:42:56,773 --> 00:42:58,263
-Sure. Yeah.
-Thank you.

454
00:42:58,608 --> 00:42:59,905
Fuck!

455
00:42:60,109 --> 00:43:2,873
-Dude, are you coming?
-Are you okay?

456
00:43:3,790 --> 00:43:4,774
I'm good. I'm good. No, I'm fine.

457
00:43:4,981 --> 00:43:6,812
-Are you all right?
-Dude, I'm fine.

458
00:43:7,150 --> 00:43:9,175
Have another cocktail.

459
00:43:13,656 --> 00:43:15,521
All right, good night.

460
00:43:16,226 --> 00:43:18,387
No, Whit. We're going to sleep.

461
00:43:18,595 --> 00:43:19,857
-We are?
-Yeah.

462
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:23,191
Okay, is he hot,
or is he too, like, eastern bloc?

463
00:43:23,399 --> 00:43:26,596
He's fine. But can we please go
get some rest? Come on.

464
00:43:26,803 --> 00:43:28,600
Oh, you're so sweet. No, I'm fine.

465
00:43:28,805 --> 00:43:30,773
It's okay. I'll take care of her.

466
00:43:31,174 --> 00:43:34,769
I'm sure you will, but not tonight,
all right? Good night, Miroslav.

467
00:43:34,978 --> 00:43:37,300
Good night, Miroslav!

468
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:47,356
I'm sorry. He was just so shady.

469
00:43:47,891 --> 00:43:50,416
Whatever. I wanted to fuck him, but....

470
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:54,287
I know you did. I'll make it up to you.

471
00:43:55,310 --> 00:43:58,592
I guess Mr. Rabbit's gonna have to
go down the hole again tonight.

472
00:44:1,504 --> 00:44:3,280
Do you have a AA?

473
00:44:3,473 --> 00:44:5,202
Mr. Rabbit!

474
00:44:5,708 --> 00:44:7,699
Come here, Rabbit!

475
00:44:13,383 --> 00:44:16,110
Do you remember the first guy
in your high school to get laid?

476
00:44:16,219 --> 00:44:17,447
No, but I remember the last.

477
00:44:17,654 --> 00:44:19,815
Well, I do. This kid Greg.

478
00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:24,722
He came back from summer break,
something about him had changed.

479
00:44:24,928 --> 00:44:28,193
It wasn't anything he said or did, but
something was different. You knew it.

480
00:44:28,398 --> 00:44:32,357
I know what you mean. It's like you can
sense it the way an animal senses it.

481
00:44:32,569 --> 00:44:34,590
Exactly. Like an animal.

482
00:44:34,337 --> 00:44:37,795
Sometimes you meet a guy and there's
something fucking scary about him...

483
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:40,805
...something that makes you think,
"This guy has killed somebody."

484
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:44,138
He doesn't have to act tough.
He never has to say it.

485
00:44:44,347 --> 00:44:46,975
But like an animal, you can sense it.

486
00:44:47,450 --> 00:44:51,409
You know that this guy's got the balls
to do what few others can.

487
00:44:52,188 --> 00:44:54,213
And that's you after today, my friend.

488
00:44:54,424 --> 00:44:57,484
People are gonna fucking fear you.
Linda is gonna fucking fear you.

489
00:44:57,694 --> 00:45:2,495
What we do today is gonna pay off
every day for the rest of our lives.

490
00:45:3,990 --> 00:45:6,227
-Where's your pager?
-It's back in the room.

491
00:45:6,436 --> 00:45:8,700
-Come on. What the fuck?
-I just figured you had yours.

492
00:45:8,905 --> 00:45:11,703
Is it me? Because it feels like
you're, like, having second thoughts.

493
00:45:11,908 --> 00:45:14,843
You've never really been into this.
I feel like I'm talking you into it.

494
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:17,604
I don't wanna be doing something
and keep talking about it--

495
00:45:17,814 --> 00:45:22,342
-It's different from taking on an image.
-I am so fucking tired of talking about it.

496
00:45:22,552 --> 00:45:24,850
It's time we fucking do it.

497
00:45:34,297 --> 00:45:35,764
To the next level.

498
00:45:35,965 --> 00:45:38,240
To the next level. No, wait.

499
00:45:38,234 --> 00:45:40,650
Isn't it bad luck to toast with water?

500
00:45:40,269 --> 00:45:44,137
Yeah. Bad luck
for whoever meets us today.

501
00:45:48,845 --> 00:45:51,336
Yeah. Let the games begin.

502
00:46:11,868 --> 00:46:13,426
Hard, hard, hard.

503
00:46:13,636 --> 00:46:15,297
Hey.

504
00:46:15,805 --> 00:46:19,241
-Hey, did she call?
-No. I just checked.

505
00:46:19,809 --> 00:46:22,676
I love that Lorna's the only one of us
that got any action last night.

506
00:46:22,879 --> 00:46:26,246
-Hey, I tried.
-Keep trying.

507
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:29,575
Yeah, she'd say
this place is majestic.

508
00:46:29,786 --> 00:46:30,753
Sure.

509
00:46:30,953 --> 00:46:32,784
I bet she's making him
breakfast right now.

510
00:46:32,989 --> 00:46:34,513
No, I bet she's in a cum coma.

511
00:46:35,291 --> 00:46:36,986
Thank God.

512
00:46:38,294 --> 00:46:40,592
At least she has something
to write about in her journal.

513
00:50:46,475 --> 00:50:47,965
Please! Please!

514
00:50:48,177 --> 00:50:49,974
Please! Stop!

515
00:50:50,246 --> 00:50:51,372
No!

516
00:50:51,580 --> 00:50:54,174
Stop! Please! Please!

517
00:51:1,230 --> 00:51:2,547
Please! Please!

518
00:51:2,758 --> 00:51:5,454
Please, no!

519
00:52:33,482 --> 00:52:35,109
Relax.

520
00:52:39,321 --> 00:52:40,913
Come up here.

521
00:54:13,782 --> 00:54:15,340
Whit?

522
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:25,957
Axelle?

523
00:54:46,882 --> 00:54:48,440
Fuck.

524
00:54:51,787 --> 00:54:53,311
Whit!

525
00:54:55,224 --> 00:54:57,210
Guys!

526
00:55:1,960 --> 00:55:3,621
Axelle! Whit!

527
00:55:47,710 --> 00:55:49,143
Stop. Please help me!

528
00:55:49,345 --> 00:55:50,835
-Go away.
-Please help me!

529
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:52,479
-Just go away from me!
-No, no, no.

530
00:55:52,915 --> 00:55:54,849
Help me.
These men are chasing me. Please.

531
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:58,850
I tried to help, but you don't listen.
Go away!

532
00:56:28,884 --> 00:56:30,647
Dollar, bitch!

533
00:56:38,961 --> 00:56:40,656
Stop!

534
00:57:12,795 --> 00:57:14,353
Get in.

535
00:57:14,596 --> 00:57:16,630
Yeah.

536
00:59:49,551 --> 00:59:52,111
The police will be here soon.

537
00:59:52,754 --> 00:59:54,813
They are looking for your friends.

538
00:59:55,557 --> 00:59:57,184
Thank-- Thank you.

539
00:59:57,793 --> 00:59:59,317
More tea?

540
00:59:59,728 --> 01:00:1,195
Please.

541
01:00:6,902 --> 01:00:8,335
Thank you.

542
01:00:23,485 --> 01:00:25,248
So, you and Sasha...

543
01:00:25,721 --> 01:00:29,122
-...are you two...?
-Oh, no. God, no.

544
01:00:29,324 --> 01:00:31,530
He's old enough to be my dad.

545
01:00:33,328 --> 01:00:34,955
What does he do?

546
01:00:35,163 --> 01:00:36,994
He does auctions.

547
01:00:37,466 --> 01:00:39,866
Come. Let's get you some clothes.

548
01:01:8,931 --> 01:01:10,728
No!

549
01:01:10,933 --> 01:01:12,491
No!

550
01:01:14,536 --> 01:01:17,699
Help! No! No!

551
01:01:36,592 --> 01:01:38,685
What did I do wrong?

552
01:01:41,563 --> 01:01:45,210
Please don't hurt me.
Please don't hurt me. I'm sorry.

553
01:01:45,834 --> 01:01:47,631
Please don't hurt me.
Please don't hurt me.

554
01:01:47,836 --> 01:01:50,310
I not hurt you.

555
01:01:50,372 --> 01:01:52,738
Okay. It's okay.

556
01:01:52,941 --> 01:01:54,101
I clean you up.

557
01:01:55,100 --> 01:01:57,444
Please, please help me.

558
01:01:58,313 --> 01:01:60,304
You have a bruise.

559
01:02:3,385 --> 01:02:4,909
What is that?

560
01:02:5,120 --> 01:02:6,781
What are you doing?

561
01:02:8,523 --> 01:02:10,457
I make you pretty.

562
01:02:11,827 --> 01:02:13,260
Pretty for what?

563
01:02:14,196 --> 01:02:15,891
For the client.

564
01:02:16,231 --> 01:02:18,358
Client? What client?

565
01:02:46,294 --> 01:02:47,625
Give me. No.

566
01:02:47,863 --> 01:02:48,830
No.

567
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,580
We do...

568
01:02:53,935 --> 01:02:55,869
...nails.

569
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:19,418
No!

570
01:03:29,538 --> 01:03:31,597
No! No!

571
01:03:37,879 --> 01:03:39,710
Oh, my God.

572
01:03:41,316 --> 01:03:42,715
No!

573
01:03:52,694 --> 01:03:54,423
I'm worried about Whit.

574
01:03:56,798 --> 01:03:58,925
Whitney seems like a tough girl.

575
01:03:59,134 --> 01:04:1,102
She'll be okay.

576
01:04:4,606 --> 01:04:6,733
You have a scratch.

577
01:04:8,744 --> 01:04:10,109
Yeah.

578
01:04:19,755 --> 01:04:22,781
-It's sore.
-I'm sorry.

579
01:04:23,792 --> 01:04:26,693
You have such beautiful skin.

580
01:04:26,895 --> 01:04:28,419
Thank you.

581
01:04:32,100 --> 01:04:33,260
Who's that?

582
01:04:34,302 --> 01:04:36,270
Just some friends.

583
01:04:36,938 --> 01:04:38,735
Come. You should lie down.

584
01:04:38,940 --> 01:04:40,908
I'll wake you up when the police arrive.

585
01:06:41,429 --> 01:06:43,226
Do you think we're sick?

586
01:06:44,766 --> 01:06:45,926
Fuck, no.

587
01:06:46,668 --> 01:06:49,398
Dude, you look anywhere in the world
where there's no law...

588
01:06:50,710 --> 01:06:52,801
...whether it's fucking Chad
or New Orleans...

589
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:55,330
...and this is the shit
people are doing, bro.

590
01:06:57,245 --> 01:06:59,179
We're the normal ones.

591
01:07:5,453 --> 01:07:7,114
Any idea what
you're gonna do in there?

592
01:07:10,425 --> 01:07:12,484
You don't even wanna know.

593
01:07:14,195 --> 01:07:16,356
You don't even wanna know.

594
01:10:45,907 --> 01:10:47,465
Jesus.

595
01:11:57,812 --> 01:11:59,507
They're listening. They're listening.

596
01:12:1,150 --> 01:12:5,760
Beth, it's me. It's Stuart.
From the fair.

597
01:12:5,420 --> 01:12:8,355
Don't talk loud. Okay?

598
01:12:8,556 --> 01:12:11,320
If they hear us talking like this...

599
01:12:11,659 --> 01:12:13,354
...they're gonna fucking kill us both.

600
01:12:14,162 --> 01:12:15,254
You hear me?

601
01:12:15,797 --> 01:12:17,594
I need to know you're listening.

602
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:20,792
Okay?

603
01:12:35,450 --> 01:12:37,748
What the fuck are you doing?

604
01:12:38,186 --> 01:12:41,485
What is this place?
Where the fuck are we?

605
01:12:42,523 --> 01:12:44,218
Stuart!

606
01:12:45,927 --> 01:12:49,693
Remember when I said that
I didn't know what I was doing here?

607
01:12:51,633 --> 01:12:53,157
Well...

608
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:57,197
...this is what I'm doing here.

609
01:12:60,241 --> 01:13:1,708
What is this place?

610
01:13:3,945 --> 01:13:5,708
This place....

611
01:13:7,480 --> 01:13:8,845
People come here....

612
01:13:10,618 --> 01:13:12,313
People come here to kill people.

613
01:13:13,921 --> 01:13:17,220
What? Who kills?

614
01:13:18,159 --> 01:13:20,127
Oh, my God, are they gonna kill us?

615
01:13:20,695 --> 01:13:21,889
Well...

616
01:13:23,364 --> 01:13:24,831
...not...

617
01:13:25,330 --> 01:13:26,261
...us.

618
01:13:27,568 --> 01:13:29,502
Oh, my God.

619
01:13:29,971 --> 01:13:32,166
Oh, my God. Are you gonna kill me?

620
01:13:32,373 --> 01:13:35,536
-You're gonna kill me!
-No. No, no! No, no, no.

621
01:13:35,743 --> 01:13:38,837
No. Jesus, no. No.

622
01:13:39,147 --> 01:13:41,445
Then what the fuck
are you doing here?

623
01:13:41,649 --> 01:13:43,207
What the fuck are you wearing?

624
01:13:43,418 --> 01:13:45,409
Someone brought me here...

625
01:13:45,620 --> 01:13:47,349
...the same as you.

626
01:13:48,289 --> 01:13:49,984
Someone I know.

627
01:13:51,326 --> 01:13:52,759
Look...

628
01:13:52,994 --> 01:13:54,723
...he wanted me to--

629
01:13:54,929 --> 01:13:57,591
To do this with him.

630
01:13:58,199 --> 01:13:59,757
What?

631
01:13:60,201 --> 01:14:1,395
Stuart, please.

632
01:14:2,103 --> 01:14:4,264
Please just let me go.
Help me get out of this chair.

633
01:14:4,472 --> 01:14:8,602
Please. Please help me get out of this
chair. Get me out of this chair, please!

634
01:14:31,165 --> 01:14:34,566
You probably used that face to get
whatever the fuck you wanted.

635
01:14:35,690 --> 01:14:37,370
Fucking skank.

636
01:14:50,518 --> 01:14:52,884
Oh, that's fucking rich.

637
01:14:53,688 --> 01:14:56,200
You should see your fucking face.

638
01:14:59,961 --> 01:15:3,226
-We gotta get out of here.
-We can't.

639
01:15:3,965 --> 01:15:6,263
They think you're gonna kill me?

640
01:15:6,768 --> 01:15:8,963
You're not some monster.

641
01:15:10,705 --> 01:15:13,300
-I'm not that guy.
-No.

642
01:15:13,207 --> 01:15:14,435
No, I know.

643
01:15:14,642 --> 01:15:17,202
-I know you're a good person.
-I'm not that guy.

644
01:15:17,945 --> 01:15:20,380
I know. Of course not.

645
01:15:20,248 --> 01:15:22,110
I'm not that guy.

646
01:15:25,319 --> 01:15:28,618
-Okay. Okay.
-I'm not that guy.

647
01:15:31,526 --> 01:15:33,460
We're gonna get out of here.

648
01:15:40,334 --> 01:15:42,234
I'm not that guy.

649
01:15:46,841 --> 01:15:48,866
I'm not that guy.

650
01:15:51,879 --> 01:15:53,904
I'm not that guy.

651
01:15:55,160 --> 01:15:56,779
There must be a co--

652
01:16:19,607 --> 01:16:21,734
Oh, fuck. Fuck.

653
01:16:37,792 --> 01:16:40,454
Christ! Fuck!

654
01:16:41,262 --> 01:16:42,627
God!

655
01:16:44,732 --> 01:16:45,790
Fuck!

656
01:16:47,680 --> 01:16:50,367
Don't you have family?
Don't you have a wife?

657
01:16:51,239 --> 01:16:52,706
My wife?

658
01:16:52,907 --> 01:16:54,602
My wife?

659
01:16:56,844 --> 01:16:58,675
I'm not allowed to kill my wife.

660
01:17:19,133 --> 01:17:21,226
-Finish?
-Yeah, I'm finished, all right.

661
01:17:21,435 --> 01:17:24,302
Hey, hey! You cannot done.

662
01:17:24,505 --> 01:17:26,200
You go in room, finish.

663
01:17:26,941 --> 01:17:28,408
You know what? I am fucking done.

664
01:17:28,609 --> 01:17:31,770
If you don't like it, you can go in
and finish her yourself.

665
01:17:31,279 --> 01:17:33,873
You cannot leave unless
you complete. It's contract.

666
01:17:34,810 --> 01:17:35,708
I fucking paid!

667
01:17:35,917 --> 01:17:37,714
You have my money
and you can keep it!

668
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:41,286
I am not going back in that room!
I'm done!

669
01:17:41,489 --> 01:17:43,354
Hey! Hey!

670
01:18:42,116 --> 01:18:44,482
Hello. Special offer.

671
01:18:44,685 --> 01:18:48,860
But she's only available
for the next 20 minutes.

672
01:18:48,322 --> 01:18:49,914
Do you want her?

673
01:18:54,795 --> 01:18:56,422
We'll let you know.

674
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:38,631
Six-fifty.

675
01:19:57,758 --> 01:19:58,725
Yes?

676
01:19:59,260 --> 01:20:4,950
Apologies for interrupting you, but
we have special available right now.

677
01:20:4,298 --> 01:20:5,629
Very good price.

678
01:20:11,505 --> 01:20:13,302
Where's Todd?

679
01:20:25,619 --> 01:20:27,348
Problem with friend.

680
01:20:30,758 --> 01:20:33,560
May I borrow this
for a moment, please?

681
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:40,924
What do you think?

682
01:20:41,135 --> 01:20:42,830
Should I do it?

683
01:20:43,370 --> 01:20:45,267
I mean, I wouldn't pay
more than a grand for her...

684
01:20:45,473 --> 01:20:47,270
...in this kind of shape, but....

685
01:20:47,475 --> 01:20:49,340
I mean, look at that.

686
01:20:49,543 --> 01:20:51,408
She's not gonna last that long, huh?

687
01:20:53,380 --> 01:20:55,780
You should see
what she did to my friend.

688
01:21:1,122 --> 01:21:2,521
I'll take her.

689
01:21:43,531 --> 01:21:45,795
A souvenir from your friend.

690
01:21:55,943 --> 01:21:58,200
Notice anything different about me?

691
01:21:60,748 --> 01:22:2,807
I bet you fucking do.

692
01:22:3,884 --> 01:22:5,681
Fucking bitch.

693
01:22:10,457 --> 01:22:12,584
Fucking respect me now.

694
01:22:14,461 --> 01:22:16,861
I don't fucking work for you!

695
01:22:18,320 --> 01:22:21,160
I don't work all fucking day
for you to humiliate me.

696
01:22:24,872 --> 01:22:26,320
To tell me I'm shit.

697
01:22:30,377 --> 01:22:31,810
Never fuck me.

698
01:22:33,214 --> 01:22:34,772
Look at you.

699
01:22:35,316 --> 01:22:36,613
What?

700
01:22:36,817 --> 01:22:39,809
What, you got something to say?
Do you? You do, bitch?

701
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:43,421
Yeah? Oh, good.
Well, it better be fucking good.

702
01:22:43,858 --> 01:22:47,350
-Let's fucking hear it. What?
-I'm not your wife.

703
01:22:47,561 --> 01:22:51,327
I'm not your wife, Stuart.
I'm not your wife.

704
01:22:52,366 --> 01:22:57,300
She doesn't understand you.
She doesn't understand you like I do.

705
01:22:57,238 --> 01:22:60,401
-And I see how you're strong.
-I am strong.

706
01:22:60,608 --> 01:23:3,338
-I am fucking Hercules!
-I see.

707
01:23:4,278 --> 01:23:6,838
I know. I know. I see it. I see it.

708
01:23:7,214 --> 01:23:8,613
I saw it last night.

709
01:23:8,816 --> 01:23:12,377
I was hoping you would kiss me.
I wanted you to kiss me.

710
01:23:14,154 --> 01:23:16,520
I thought about you all night.

711
01:23:23,564 --> 01:23:25,725
Get on the fucking floor.

712
01:23:35,709 --> 01:23:37,108
Are you scared?

713
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:42,710
You fucking better be.

714
01:23:43,784 --> 01:23:45,342
I am.

715
01:23:46,253 --> 01:23:48,500
I like it.

716
01:24:2,169 --> 01:24:3,727
Look at me.

717
01:24:6,600 --> 01:24:7,371
Bitch.

718
01:24:8,742 --> 01:24:11,472
You fucking whore.

719
01:24:36,470 --> 01:24:38,301
Get in the chair!

720
01:24:38,505 --> 01:24:40,302
Get in the fucking chair!

721
01:24:44,511 --> 01:24:45,978
Fucker!

722
01:25:3,364 --> 01:25:4,331
What's the code?

723
01:25:4,665 --> 01:25:6,496
Fuck you!

724
01:25:10,604 --> 01:25:12,162
What's the fucking code?

725
01:25:15,809 --> 01:25:17,572
-Your birthday.
-What?

726
01:25:17,778 --> 01:25:19,575
What is your birthday?

727
01:25:19,780 --> 01:25:21,714
December 1 2th.

728
01:25:23,384 --> 01:25:26,120
Oh, that is fucking sick.

729
01:25:42,803 --> 01:25:44,236
What the fuck? It's not opening.

730
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:48,736
It's not fucking opening!

731
01:25:48,942 --> 01:25:50,807
Oh, yes, it is.

732
01:25:52,790 --> 01:25:55,105
Do it! She's right up there
behind you! Kill her!

733
01:25:55,315 --> 01:25:58,113
Motherfucker! Shoot her!

734
01:25:58,452 --> 01:25:60,852
Kill her! Kill her!

735
01:26:4,124 --> 01:26:5,853
Don't shoot!
Be careful, for God's sakes!

736
01:26:6,600 --> 01:26:8,510
She'll cut! She'll fucking cut!
Don't shoot!

737
01:26:8,262 --> 01:26:9,593
Fucking she'll cut! She'll cut!

738
01:26:10,831 --> 01:26:12,162
Get Sasha!

739
01:26:12,399 --> 01:26:16,267
You gotta do it! I'm the fucking
customer here! Do it, for fuck's sake.

740
01:26:16,470 --> 01:26:18,301
Jesus fucking Christ. Oh, shit!

741
01:26:18,505 --> 01:26:19,563
-Sasha!
-Get him!

742
01:26:37,424 --> 01:26:39,324
-Wait! I wanna buy my way out of here.
-Wait!

743
01:26:42,696 --> 01:26:45,688
-You can't afford it.
-Don't tell me what I can't afford.

744
01:26:45,899 --> 01:26:50,630
There's nothing I can't afford. I could
buy and sell everyone in this room.

745
01:26:51,205 --> 01:26:53,400
You going to call your parents
for money?

746
01:26:53,607 --> 01:26:55,700
No, motherfucker, it's my money.

747
01:26:55,909 --> 01:26:58,901
Just get me a PDA, a SWlFT number
and a recipient name.

748
01:26:59,113 --> 01:27:1,980
I have accounts in Switzerland,
Luxembourg and the lsle of Man.

749
01:27:2,182 --> 01:27:6,243
Just name your fucking price!
Trust me, I got it.

750
01:27:8,122 --> 01:27:9,646
Okay.

751
01:27:15,195 --> 01:27:16,321
We negotiate.

752
01:27:17,598 --> 01:27:20,431
-This is bullshit!
-This is business.

753
01:27:20,734 --> 01:27:21,792
I'll pay more!

754
01:27:22,236 --> 01:27:24,204
Not with a second mortgage
on your house...

755
01:27:24,404 --> 01:27:26,463
...and your daughter's
private-school tuition.

756
01:27:26,940 --> 01:27:28,635
That's why your friend pay.

757
01:27:28,842 --> 01:27:30,707
What's the number?

758
01:27:31,845 --> 01:27:34,245
Money is not the only issue.

759
01:27:34,448 --> 01:27:36,750
We have contract here.

760
01:27:36,884 --> 01:27:38,317
What kind of contract?

761
01:27:39,786 --> 01:27:42,414
Anyone who come to this place...

762
01:27:42,623 --> 01:27:44,250
...cannot leave...

763
01:27:44,458 --> 01:27:46,160
...without killing.

764
01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:50,487
They're still gonna kill you,
you fucking stupid cunt.

765
01:27:51,899 --> 01:27:53,628
What did you say to me?

766
01:27:55,569 --> 01:27:58,367
You're a stupid fucking cu--!

767
01:28:15,255 --> 01:28:16,620
Let him bleed to death.

768
01:28:18,392 --> 01:28:19,416
Misha, no!

769
01:28:60,330 --> 01:29:1,967
Isn't this great?

770
01:29:8,308 --> 01:29:10,572
Hey, get back here!

771
01:29:12,746 --> 01:29:13,940
Wait!

772
01:29:14,147 --> 01:29:16,470
Wait! Wait!

773
01:29:17,818 --> 01:29:18,910
Wait!

774
01:29:20,530 --> 01:29:21,200
Hey!

775
01:29:21,455 --> 01:29:24,490
You fucking shit! Wait!

776
01:34:26,126 --> 01:34:28,260
Bitches!
